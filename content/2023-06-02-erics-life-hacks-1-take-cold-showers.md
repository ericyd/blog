## TLDR

Don't wait for your water to heat up before you hop into your shower. Step in, stare directly into your shower head, and turn on the water full blast. Cold showers are more invigorating, they conserve water and energy, and they will make you feel alive again.

## The life hack in a nutshell

About 3-4 months ago I started taking cold showers after my morning workouts. I've since transitioned to _always_ taking cold showers, regardless of time of day or workout status. For me, a "cold shower" means getting into the shower with no water running, staring straight into the shower head, and turning on the water full blast before any hot water can come out. I have a shower with two handles - one for cold and one for hot - and my current preference is to turn on the cold handle 100% and the hot handle about 25%. That way the shower slowly becomes more "room temperature" as the hot water starts to flow.

One major caveat I'll note is that I live in Texas, so it is reasonably warm most of the year. I acknowledge that this practice will take substantially more willpower if you live in a colder climate.

## Why?

I've noticed several benefits to taking cold showers:

1. More personal energy. As I age, I'm always looking for ways to boost my energy. Cold showers are an easy way to feel energized and invigorated for the day ahead
2. Less water and electricity. When I'm taking a cold shower, I'm less likely to stay for a long time because my mind is focused and alert, rather than relaxed and placid. This means I take shorter showers on average. Shorter, colder showers directly lead to less energy consumption too: water heaters [account for about 20% of most home's energy use](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/water-heating).
3. Increased sense of accomplishment and willpower. It's always a nice feeling when you accomplish something difficult. It is even more gratifying when that difficult thing becomes a new habit. Starting to take cold showers requires significant willpower and focus; when it develops into a habit, it feels empowering and boosts my morale.

## How?

I found that creating a ritual around the initial discomfort of a cold shower was helpful for me to start this practice. My ritual looked like this.

1. When I step into the bathroom, mentally remind myself that I'm going to take a cold shower
2. Repeat a phrase to myself to justify the cold shower. For me, a short phrase is a great way to remind myself that the discomfort is temporary and the benefits are much more persistent.
3. No hesitation: Figure out a way to reduce as much friction as possible to starting the shower. You can't spend a lot of time thinking about it, you must set up a system in which you can act without much thought. This might mean setting things up the night before so you can hop in without thinking about any details like soap, towels, lights, bathroom fan, etc.

## Conclusion

Cold showers have been a great change for me. Try it out for a week and if you aren't convinced, you can go back to your warm spa showers.
