## TLDR

"Should" is the worst word. When used without context or qualification, it implies the existence of a universal value system to which everyone is beholden. It instigates feelings of inferiority and inadequacy while providing no concrete value in conversation.

## The worst word

Using the word "should" feels benign. It _should_ be a safe word; after all, it is not commonly seen as an offensive or pejorative word in most contexts.

But what does "should" really mean? [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/should) provides what I believe is the most common usage of "should":

> used in auxiliary function to express obligation, propriety, or expediency

And they provide as an example:

> you _should_ brush your teeth after each meal

It is worth asking: when does one _ever_ want "to express obligation, propriety, or expediency"? In what circumstances is it beneficial to indicate what someone else (or yourself) is obligated to do? Certainly there are real circumstances in which obligations must be acknowledged and adhered to. I contend, however, that the vast majority of colloquial "should"s are used to blindly indicate some overarching principal to which everyone is implicitly bound. Rather than indicating a real life obligation or propriety, it is used lazily to indicate the ways in which someone is expected to behave without ever explicitly stating _why_ one is expected behave this way.

Why do I care if people are casually suggesting that we must adhere to an arbitrary set of unspoken values? Because it frequently has one of two outcomes:

1. It contributes to feelings of guilt, e.g. "I know I _should_ do it this way but I just don't have the energy"
2. It normalizes adherence to an unspoken set of values which may not be applicable to the person or situation in question

What I am advocating instead of active, conscious involvement in choosing how and why to live and act. In addition, I am advocating _guilt-free_ living; surely we should be free to make our own decisions without feeling a weight of judgment from ourselves and others.

## Active, conscious living

Choosing to actively engage in your life is one of the most empowering choices you can make. When you decide how to live your life, you ensure that you are living the life you _want_ to live. This is not a defence of hedonism; it is merely an observation that when actions are taken deliberately, they are much more likely to bring purpose and joy to your life.

Too often, people are pressured to behave in ways that do not align with their own values or interests. The result is quite literally "mob mentality" where people behave like their peers simply because they have never considered an alternative. This serves no one; when we individually lose our passions and values, we collectively normalize a homogenized, monocultural response to everything. It is a compromise on what it means to live.

This might sound extreme, but that is the point. Every unqualified use of the word "should" is a nudge towards conformity with behavioral values that you may or may not agree with. Do yourself a favor and just ask the question: "why _should_ I do this?"

You'll notice that I specifically mention _unqualified_ use of the word "should". This is highly important because, as we'll see, qualified use of the word if perfectly suitable and can be a useful tool to actively engaging in your own life.

## Guilt

The other dominant effect of unmitigated usage of the word "should" is a latent sense of guilt about one's choices. If I believe that I _should_ not be doing the thing that I'm doing, then I may rightly feel guilty about acting that way.

Who does this guilt serve? **Nobody!** Why are we allowing ourselves to be taken over by guilt for something when we may not even know _why_ we are supposed to feel guilty about it? Do you know _why_ you "should" be doing something? If not, consider that the "should" may be illegitimate, and you can safely unbind yourself from whatever expectation was attached to it.

Persistent feelings of guilt can be a major drain on energy and mood. There is no reason to accept guilt into your mind that isn't serving a purpose. You owe it to yourself to question the implicit judgments of "should" and free yourself from the guilt of unspoken value systems.

## Qualified vs Unqualified "should"

Here's an example of an unqualified "should"

> I should really vacuum my carpet

Here's an example of a qualified "should"

> I should really vacuum my carpet, because I am having guests over later and I want them to be as comfortable as possible

The (hopefully obvious) difference between the two is that an unqualified "should" provides no context for _why_ a particular behavior is expected. The use of the word "should" implies a value judgement - that one choice is superior to another - yet provides no justification for why this is so. In a world of limitless ways to spend our time and energy, how does one know if one option is truly superior to another without considering how the two options align with their values? In the example above, feeling that "I should vacuum" fills me with a sense of guilt and passivity; I will vacuum simply because I feel that I must. But what if I live alone and today is the last day to visit a friend before they move out of town? Surely vacuuming becomes significantly less important! This is the value of _actively and consciously_ choosing your activities. Without questioning the values behind the "should", it is too easy to blindly accept someone else's value judgment of how you "should" spend your time.

In contrast, the qualified should makes it extremely clear why the behavior of vacuuming is desired: I value making my guests comfortable; I have guests coming laater today; therefore I should vacuum because doing so will increase their comfort. There is no ambiguity about why the task is desirable, and it is immediately clear that the action aligns with your values.

## Final thoughts

- Be active, conscious, and thoughtful about your behaviors
- Do not accept a value judgment that does not align with your personal value system
- Be aware of "should" creeping into your thoughts! It's not just in spoken language that this word can wreak havoc on one's mind
