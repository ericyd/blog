I saw an email today from an acquaintaince who was leaving their job which signed off with the phrase:

> It's not goodbye, it's see you later!

No. That's wrong. It **is** goodbye. I will never see you again.

Get comfortable with saying goodbye. Avoiding uncomfortable truths is not a gift to yourself or others.

Be honest. Acknowledge that everything ends eventually. Making space for loss opens up space for gratitude; it allows you to fully appreciate the time you shared as a temporary and wonderful moment in life which will not happen again.
