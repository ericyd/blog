I guess I haven't blogged about savory oatmeal before. Well I'm here to tell you I was eating savory oatmeal before it was cool. I'm a huge believer in savory oatmeal because sweet oatmeal gets old too fast. Everyone loves a good savory breakfast, why not treat yourself to a healthy, savory breakfast at home?

When most people hear about savory oatmeal, they usually start retching. Most people are idiots. Here's a simple recipe that is fucking delicious and you need to make it now:

## Ingredients

- ½ cup oats
- 1 cup water
- 1 tsp za'atar
- 1 tsp nutritional yeast (optional)
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- ¼ tsp salt
- A healthy drizzle of olive oil

All amounts can be adjusted to taste, except for the oats and water.

## Directions

1. Add all incredients to a small pot
2. Bring it to a light boil
3. Simmer according to instructions for your oats. Quick oats take about a minute, normal rolled oats are usually closer to 5 minutes.
4. Eat it.
