# When this is un-commented, the `/micro` directory will generate 2 outputs: JSON and HTML.
# HTML is the default, so without specifying this config, HTML will always be generated.
# My goal with JSON was to generate a JSON file and make my micro blog data-drive with a little helper JS, Ã  la https://github.com/ericyd/generative-art/blob/b584b6d05e00e533f4c5bdacf23f92aee48f9ac7/docs/index.html#L55-L340
# The problem I'm not sure how to solve yet is how to make the dynamic routes work correctly, for individual microblogs.
# I would like someone to be able to link to a direct microblog, but I'm not sure if it's possible to handle "route params" in Cloudflare pages and/or Hugo.
