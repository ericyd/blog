- In defense of disorganization (because not everything is truly important enough to get done - think of a sick day)
- In defense of death (because everyone wants to live forever)
- In defense of selflessness (because satisfying the ego is not inherently superior to boosting others egos, and we actually are less important than we think)
- In defense of NOT maximizing your money (because you likely already have enough, and chasing more will only serve to make you greedy)
- Ego is simply a survival mechanism. Once you reach a threshold where you don't need ego for survival, you no longer need to feed your ego. It will only prevent you from being compassionate and patient
- I've been consumed recently with the concept of "importance". As in, the fact that things are always important in the moment and rarely important in hindsight. That importance is fully self-ascribed yet we experience it as an immutable, irrevocable, fundamental quality of whatever phenomenon we deem important. How much control do we have over what we believe to be important? Is adjusting our view of what is important the key to peace? And compassion? (to recognize that other people believe a phenomenon to be important, even if you do not. And conversely, to recognize that you will believe certain phenomena to be important, even if others do not.) Is the sense of what is important in the world a defining characteristic of our unique human experience? Is our experience of importance directly tied to our values, or are there other factors that contribute to our sense of importance? What happens if we accept that nothing is inherently important, and we embrace the idea that things are only important when we ascribe that quality to them?
- Remember that I am but a single person. My outrage does not matter to anyone but myself. In 100 years or less, all vestiges of my existence will be scattered at an atomic level, or wholly dissociated from my person. Nothing I do matters beyond the meaning that I assign to my actions.
  - With this in mind, I wish to act in a way that enhances the wellbeing of those around me while maintaining a perspective of balance.
- The next time you want to say something, stop and ask yourself whom it benefits. If it is only yourself, shut up.
- People are so reluctant to let you make mistakes, they would rather stop you from acting at all than act and learn from a mistake. I think some people assume that at some point in life, you stop making mistakes. But mistakes are as normal as life. You keep paying attention and you keep learning. There is only an end to mistakes if you stop living; the act of being alive and making choices is an act of accepting the possibility of mistakes. (this is in relation to quitting acorns, and wondering if it's a mistake after Hugh's conversation with me, during which he told me explicitly that he thinks it's a mistake)
- "If you're searching for it, then it's already in front of you." This phrase came to me while tripping on acid at Port Aransas on the new year weekend. I can't quite find better words for it but I think it means everything you need is already here. Be content with what you have.
- French protests - what does it mean to be owed something by society or government? How does one quantify what is deserved? How does one quantify an equitable exchange of one's time and energy for money and social services? Why is it challenging to care for workers? What does the distribution of wealth tell us about this moment in history?
- Is there a moral imperative to give away your money? At what threshold? Is there a moral imperative to give away generational inheritance? What portion? For whom? Where is the boundary between passively accepting money (e.g. inheritance) and actively working against systemic inequality (e.g. hoarding money that historically was extracted from exploited labor)?

- "Texas is the best, Texas is the worst". Religious freedoms, voting rights, local self-governing, housing, drugs, abortion, health care, taxation. But god damn its nice to be outside every day of the year
