Candidates

## Inflorescence - Mike Dillon and Punkadelic

[https://found.ee/Inflorescence](https://found.ee/Inflorescence)

- Groove-based jazz
- Title track is a compelling journey; hopeful, intense, interesting
- Some interesting fluidity with time... the band doesn't always seem to agree on where the downbeat is

## Tchompitoulas - Galactic

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/271984687](https://tidal.com/browse/album/271984687)

- Groovy, funky
- dirty, tight, powerful funk. Classic Galactic
- New Orleans style blues / brass
- very fun album!

## Phil Ranelin and Wendell Harrison JID016

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/264117758](https://tidal.com/browse/album/264117758)

- Some fairly avante-garde pieces. The intro track is very spacy and freestyle
- Also some really tight grooves! "Running With The Tribe" is a really tight groove and great arrangement
- Very interesting album, and fun! Interesting mix of spacey atmosphere and groovy. They do a good job of playing with time through the whole album

## King Canyon - King Canyon

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/266766309](https://tidal.com/browse/album/266766309)

- Smooth, groovy, melodic, jammy, what is not to like!
- Only bad thing I can say about it is too short!

## Winter - Otis McDonald

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/251576877](https://tidal.com/browse/album/251576877)

- Really interesting album. Pretty short, just over 20mins total runtime. I need to give this another listen

## Legacy - Emile Londonien

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/258057189](https://tidal.com/browse/album/258057189)

- Jazz
- horns, rhodes, electric bass, grooving pocket drumming, hand percussion (congas?), synths. Opening track is jamming!
- the first three tracks are excellent. Grooves are a little "trippy" (need to look up what this is called when its laying back behind the beat), really great bass playing and cool instrumentation. Great atmosphere and interesting compositions

## Lotus Glow - Adi Oasis

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/266900810](https://tidal.com/browse/album/266900810)

- R&B mostly. Really nice grooves actually. Funky backing tracks
- Good atmosphere, feel-good arrangements
- Some really great grooves from the band actually, it is really a band, not just a solo singer
- I really like this album actually, its _very_ funky and just really fun compositions
- This has become a staple of "cleaning day music". Easy to listen to but really rich, interesting, and fun sounds!

## Everything Is Going to Be OK - GoGo Penguin

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/285513521](https://tidal.com/browse/album/285513521)

[https://songwhip.com/gogo-penguin/everything-is-going-to-be-ok](https://songwhip.com/gogo-penguin/everything-is-going-to-be-ok)

- lovely ☺️
- "Friday Film Special" is probably an early front runner for fav track. It has one of those melodies that feels like its been around forever and finally found a medium to come into the world.
- some really neat electronic textures throughout. Very full sound (although they have never really been a "thin" sounding band)
- "We May Not Stay" feels very narrative
- title track is fabulous, amazing bass lines and really beautiful organic growth to the climax
- damn "Parasite" is great too!!!

# Other albums I listened to

## Cloud Lifter - Sam Barsh

https://tidal.com/browse/album/291340976

- kind of unfocused? Some tracks are kind of trip-hop/instrumental hip-hop vibes, then _Duff and a Shot_ is like a retro blues/funk organ trio jam. I kind of like the vibes, it is all pretty groovy morning time music, I'm just not sure how cohesive it is as an album. (Granted, this is my "halfway through" reaction.)

## Friendship EP - Surprise Chef

https://tidal.com/browse/album/278822105

- pensive, groovy, spacey
- really good! Deserves another listen!
- interesting album, but a fun one

## Salt - Half Moon Run

https://tidal.com/browse/album/287079711

- kind of like crooning, acousting guitar pop?
- not something I see myself returning to very much
- not "bad" or anything, just not quite my style

## Off-Piste - Greg Foat, Art Themen

https://tidal.com/browse/album/288489375

- kind of atmospheric jazz in general. Not to say it's formless, but leans more towards "spacey" than "funky".
- very interesting textures, and some good grooves. Well made music
- I'd like to give this another listen if I have time

## Lean In - Gretchen Parlato, Lionel Loueke

https://tidal.com/browse/album/272608863

- I find this album pretty interesting, very mellow, lilting, melodic, happy, peaceful, rhymically interesting

## Ubuntu - Jonathan Butler

https://tidal.com/browse/album/280816123

- Lots of interesting influences here! Good album overall
- Some groovy, but mostly I'd say its a pretty album. Very melodic, very peaceful
- Would definitely like to listen to this again

## Krasno/Moore Project: Book of Queens - Eric Krasno, Stanton Moore

https://tidal.com/browse/album/281058057

- very bluesy! Some covers, but mostly originals (as far as I can tell)
- strong pocket grooves
- great easy listening jams

## That! Feels Good! - Jessie Ware

https://tidal.com/browse/album/290581948

- dancey, poppy, feels good. It will make you move. It will make you funk. It will make your head bop.
- _Free Yourself_ feels kind of like a disco-era club hit
- Title track has some ridiculously funky instrumentation and riffs
- _Shake The Bottle_ has one of those dead-simple-meets-ultra-funky bass lines that is reminiscent of her earlier _What's Your Pleasure_ album. It sounds like something that Bootsy Collins would write back in the day.

## A Good Woman - Izo FitzRoy

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/269842734](https://tidal.com/browse/album/269842734)

- bluesy, folksy, a little pop-y
- I think I like it, after the first few songs I'm very interested to hear the rest of it

## Riot Jazz Makes People Happy - Riot Jazz Brass Band

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/269857854](https://tidal.com/browse/album/269857854)

- High energy brassy funky groovy!
- overall the album is only ok actually :\ I was hoping for more but it didn't really do it for me. Couple great tracks but not mind blowing

## Brand New Life - Brandee Younger

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/286308904](https://tidal.com/browse/album/286308904)

- Surprisingly emotive. Maybe it was just the mood I was in, but I found the compositions and her singing to be quite beautiful
- mix of R&B and jazz. I think Brandee is a mallet instrument player, there is a lot of vibraphone on this album. Lots of harp too actually.
- This is a good album for sure, not sure if its "top 5" material or not but it is good!

## Ask - Altin Gün

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/284698087](https://tidal.com/browse/album/284698087)

- Psychedelic Turkish rock. Pretty good! Deserves another listen. I'm not sure its a top album of the year but it is good

## fOUR Step Aside - Nate Wood

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/245039310](https://tidal.com/browse/album/245039310)

- I didn't really like it. Kind of avant-garde electronic jazz-pop?

## Madres - Sofia Koutesis

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/279534070](https://tidal.com/browse/album/279534070)

- Electronic! Emotionally light, organic EDM. Some vocals but mostly used as an instrument.
- Happy vibes

## Life & Fire - Omar Klein, Haggai Cohen-Milo, Amir Bresler

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/277319688](https://tidal.com/browse/album/277319688)

- Jazz - piano, drum, bass trio
- Fun music! Dave Brubeck is coming to mind for some reason?

## Welcome to the Hills - Yussef Dayes, Charlie Stacy, Rocco Palladino

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/243104004](https://tidal.com/browse/album/243104004)

- interesting, kind of dark jazz
- damn this is a very jammy jazz album! I like that the compositions are darker, they feel kind of complex and slightly untethered, but still are a lot of beauty to them. And some really cool solos
- some parts are actually riff-based, which I think is what was eluding me about it. "Palladino Sauce" starts with a phaser-ed bass riff that sounds like it could open a rock anthem. Then moves into a fantastic syncopated riff.
- Strong contender!

## Prime - Dave Stryker, Jared Gold, McClenty Hunter Jr.

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/262212838](https://tidal.com/browse/album/262212838)

- Organ trio (organ, guitar, drums)
- Fairly strong jazziness!
- Good but not "top 5" material i don't think

## Where You Wish You Were - Bill Laurence, Michael League

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/257607774](https://tidal.com/browse/album/257607774)

- I don't know how to describe the genre.
- Basically just piano and double bass
- The compositions are sometimes fun and bouncy, sometimes more thoughtful
- Definitely "jazz"... not totally sure its my thing, but its kind of nice.
- Some tracks remind me of a softer/slower version of GoGo Penguin. "Sant Esteve" is a good example of this style. Consistent hook, non-standard time signatures, kind of a monotonous pedal tone vibe from the guitar in certain sections

## COOKUP - Sam Gendel

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/269706613](https://tidal.com/browse/album/269706613)

- jazzy covers of classic pop + R&B songs, like from the 90s. Pretty weird album. Kind of interesting nostalgia, but not the most outstanding IMO

## BY THE WAY - Theo Croker

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/274054830](https://tidal.com/browse/album/274054830)

- R&B, neo-soul vibes. It is good! Not sure its my most fav album I've heard though

## Valley of Fire - El Ten Eleven

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/263458752](https://tidal.com/browse/album/263458752)

- honestly not sure what to call this. Kind of like light indie rock I guess, with a dark mood?
- deserves another listen, there is some interesting music here for sure

## Taken by Force - Civic

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/274869603](https://tidal.com/browse/album/274869603)

- Rock album. Not bad rock actually, just not what I listen to much anymore

## Raven - Kelela

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/271895787](https://tidal.com/browse/album/271895787)

- Kind of neo-soul, some pop
- Rich instrumentation, kind of classic neo-soul chanteuse semi-breathy vocals
- Nice beats, very listenable. Approachable sound

## SuperBlue: Guilty Pleasures - Kurt Elling, Charlie Hunter, Nate Smith

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/265466885](https://tidal.com/browse/album/265466885)

- Covers of classic soul/funk tunes
- Great musicianship as expected from these artists
- Definitely a fun album. First impression is not a "best of the year" album but some great grooves, maybe it will grow on me

## On the Far Side - Thomas Naïm

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/263174419](https://tidal.com/browse/album/263174419)

- SUMMARY: probably not for me, but a pleasant listen
- contemplative guitar-driven, soulful compositions
- relaxing
- textural
- deep pocket grooves
- dark soundscape
- this is a nice album but probably not a "best of 2023". I guess we'll see how I feel later in the year though. Very peaceful, well-composed, well-performed, but it isn't totally "my style". Slightly too sleepy

## Your Mother Should Know: Brad Mehldau Plays The Beatles

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/272455468](https://tidal.com/browse/album/272455468)

- didn't end up listening to this, I wasn't in the mood for solo piano playing beatles covers

## Unjust - Ben Wolfe

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/267247604](https://tidal.com/browse/album/267247604)

- really traditional jazz, I didn't listen to the whole thing but I couldn't get into it

# Not from 2023

## Heritage II - Mark de Clive-Lowe (2019)

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/224308107](https://tidal.com/browse/album/224308107)

- jazz, but heavy on texture. Not strongly groove oriented, but highly melodic and interesting harmonies and intstumentation
- its a good album, very interesting but also listenable. I'm compelled to come back for another listen
- I think this guy released something in 2023, but I don't remember liking it as much as this one
