## Albums I listened to

* _Mount Masu_, Yin Yin
    * https://tidal.com/browse/album/327318531
    * Very, very good! I am feeling like I'll want to buy this on Bandcamp
    * Groovy, smooth, and fukin' cool
* _MINT JAMS(Live)_, Casiopea
    * https://tidal.com/browse/album/157660479
    * super fun classic funk/prog/jams!
* _Robby Krieger & the Soul Savages_, Robby Krieger
    * really fun! Robby Krieger is the guitarist for The Doors apparently
* _The Drop_, Jeff Lorber
    * Released in 2023 but a really fun modern jazz album. It has that sound that I think turns off a lot of people, really shimmery keyboards, but I thought it was fun
* _Parasols_, Orgone
    * Just an EP but it is solid!
* _L'Impératrice_, Tako Tsubo
    * A coworker described this as "Daft Punk style", which I don't agree with, but I do think it's a really fun album!
* _Fronzoli_, Psychedlic Porn Crumpets
    * I was OK on my first listen of this
* _Wall Of Eyes_, The Smile
    * This artist is a collab between the singer and guitarist of Radiohead and the drummer of Sons of Kemet!
    * This is actually a pretty great album. Definitely will listen again. Mellow, but very strong songwriting.
* _Vultures_, Ghostland Observatory
    * Some good songs, but not sure I feel compelled to come back to it anytime soon.
