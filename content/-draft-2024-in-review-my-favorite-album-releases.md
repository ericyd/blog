## Albums I listened to

* _Mount Masu_, Yin Yin
    * https://tidal.com/browse/album/327318531
    * Very, very good! I am feeling like I'll want to buy this on Bandcamp
    * Groovy, smooth, and fukin' cool
    * I've listened to this several times recently and it _really_ holds up, this is agreat album.
* _MINT JAMS(Live)_, Casiopea
    * https://tidal.com/browse/album/157660479
    * super fun classic funk/prog/jams!
* _Robby Krieger & the Soul Savages_, Robby Krieger
    * really fun! Robby Krieger is the guitarist for The Doors apparently
* _The Drop_, Jeff Lorber
    * Released in 2023 but a really fun modern jazz album. It has that sound that I think turns off a lot of people, really shimmery keyboards, but I thought it was fun
* _Parasols_, Orgone
    * Just an EP but it is solid!
* _L'Imp√©ratrice_, Tako Tsubo
    * A coworker described this as "Daft Punk style", which I don't agree with, but I do think it's a really fun album!
* _Fronzoli_, Psychedlic Porn Crumpets
    * I was OK on my first listen of this
* _Wall Of Eyes_, The Smile
    * This artist is a collab between the singer and guitarist of Radiohead and the drummer of Sons of Kemet!
    * This is actually a pretty great album. Definitely will listen again. Mellow, but very strong songwriting.
* _Vultures_, Ghostland Observatory
    * Some good songs, but not sure I feel compelled to come back to it anytime soon.
* _What Now_, Brittany Howard
    * Need to listen again. Very much an album of loss. Didn't grab me super strong the first time, but would like to listen again
* _Searching for Tomorrow_, Timecop 1983
    * AWESOME synthwave album
    * EXCEPT for the 3 tracks with vocals, which I HATE
* _Ted Tapes 2024_, Goose
    * First track is a 34 minute jam, so you can't go wrong
    * I haven't heard of Goose before but they definitely fit into the jam/fusion genre nicely it seems. Digging the album so far! Seems very stereotypically up my alley.
* _A Trip to the Moon_, Ghost Funk Orchestra
    * https://tidal.com/browse/album/328546015
    * I enjoyed this and would like to listen to it again. It has some fun songs, although I'm not sure if I feel it's extremely cohesive as an album.
    * But that kinda makes me want to listen again, and see if I feel the same way on a re-listen
* _Chorus_, Mildlife
    * nice instrumentals, melodic, groovy
    * vocals kind of turn me off a little bit
    * kind of reminds me of poolside
* _Three_, Four Tet
    * Pretty classic Four Tet actually! Mellow, smooth, electronic, textured, deep, organic. I'll listen to this again for sure
    * "So Blue" stuck out to me on my first listen
* _Mahal_, Glass Beams
    * ooh, kind of an eastern psychedelic vibe, really nice!
    * too short :D
* _Notebook Fantasy, Chicano Batman
    * damn, this might be one of their best! I need to listen to it again, but first listen this felt like gold
* _A LA SALA_, Khruangbin
    * need to listen again, felt pretty mellow even by Kruangbin standards but only listened to it once on a plane so lots of nuance was lost
