Most experiences in life are wave-like. Grief, love, joy, melancholy, boredom, excitement, interests, hobbies - they all wax and wane with time. The frequency and amplitude varies over time of course, and the waves are rarely (never?) perfectly sinusoidal, but this basic metaphor matches much of my lived experience. Thinking of experience as wave-like is useful for me, because it helps me remember to celebrate the good moments, and not dwell in the low moments. All moments are fleeting, so it is best to simply accept them as they are.
