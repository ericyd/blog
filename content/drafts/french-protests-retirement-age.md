France has had quite an interesting year. [Since January, the country has seen ongoing bouts of civil unrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_French_pension_reform_unrest) in response to the Government's proposed pension reforms. The crux of the proposed reforms is a gradual increase in the retirement age from 62 years old currently to 65 years old by 2031.

This post will not be an investigation of France's specific cultural makeup, nor will it dive deeply into the sociopolitical climate that led to these reform proposals and the resulting protests. It will certainly not discuss the police response to the protests, or the perspective from unions. The motivation for this post is to look at what I believe to be universally relevant questions that affect all of us. The French protests provide a microcosm of humanity in which we can think about some interesting questions.

How does one quantify what one is deserved? What is a person owed from their government? Are the answers to these questions universal? If French people deserve to stop working at age 62, should these rules apply to all humans? Are the French exceptional?

How does one quantify an equitable exchange of one's time and energy for money and social services?

Why is it challenging to care for workers? What does the distribution of wealth tell us about this moment in history?

What does it mean to be owed something by society or government? Paying money into a system
