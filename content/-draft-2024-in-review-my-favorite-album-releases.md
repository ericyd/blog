This is the third time I've compiled some favorite album releases from the year. Here are my previous two posts:

- [2023 favorite album releases](/2023-in-review-my-favorite-album-releases)
- [2022 favorite album releases](/my-favorite-album-releases-of-2022)

I went in a slightly different direction this year. One of the goals I set for myself this year was to purchase more music, as a way to support artists I enjoy. Streaming services are wonderful for consumers and terrible for producers, and I wanted to be more active in how I engaged with musical artists this year.

My goal was to purchase one album a month. I ended up buying 12 albums total this year, although I didn't stick to the calendar very well (5 were purchased in December as I realized I was behind on my goal). Not all of my purchases were released this year, but many of them were. Without further ado, here are the albums I purchased this year.

## 2024 releases

I always have a soft spot for new music. Here are the albums released this year that I liked enough to purchase.

### [_Mount Masu_, Y朝n Y朝n](https://yinyin.bandcamp.com/album/mount-matsu)

This album has _extremely_ high replayability. There's a wonderful balance of driving pocket grooves, lush synth textures, and beautiful slow jams. I have a hard time imagining a person who doesn't like this album at all.

### [_Mustard n'Onions_, Ghost-Note](https://ghost-note.bandcamp.com/album/mustard-nonions)

Hands down the best funk album of 2024, possibly the entire 2020s, possibly the entire millenium! I saw them live at the Parish Theater in Austin, TX and it was one of the best shows I can remember seeing. Absolute artistic mastery from start to finish. I loved it, and the recorded album is just as fantastic.

### [_Do What You Want_, Bill Laurance](https://billlaurance.bandcamp.com/album/do-what-you-want)

If you're looking for the absolute _tastiest_ overdriven Rhodes tones you've ever heard, _please_ do yourself a favor and check out _Do What You Want_. The opening track "Set Piece" is dark and moody and delicious.

### [_Talkie Talkie_, Los Bitchos](https://losbitchos.bandcamp.com/album/talkie-talkie)

Possibly the most fun release of 2024! I love this album and can listen to it nearly on repeat.

### [_Goat_, Goat](https://goat.bandcamp.com/album/goat)

The first time I listened to this album, I was not super impressed with it. But something drew me back for a second listen, then a third. It ended up having one of my highest listening counts of any album this year. This album was released shortly after my dog died, and it really matched the "fuck it" brand of depression I was feeling. There is something cathartic about this album in the way that it is so free, so raw, and so visceral. The production confuses me with it's chaotic mixing style, but somehow it adds to the energy of the album.

### [_Lagos Paris London_, Yannis & The Yaw](https://yannistheyaw.bandcamp.com/album/lagos-paris-london)

### [_Three_, Four Tet](https://fourtet.bandcamp.com/album/three)
    * Pretty classic Four Tet actually! Mellow, smooth, electronic, textured, deep, organic. I'll listen to this again for sure
    * "So Blue" stuck out to me on my first listen

### [_Big Party_, FORQ](https://store.groundupmusic.net/products/big-party-mp3-download)

## Older releases that I purchased to backfill my music collection

### [_Culcha Vulcha_, Snarky Puppy](https://store.groundupmusic.net/products/culcha-vulcha-mp3-download)

This might be my favorite album of all time. I absolutely love it from start to finish and I wanted it for my personal collection.

### [_Aftersun_, Bill Laurance](https://billlaurance.bandcamp.com/album/aftersun)

The textures and rhythms in this album are just fantastic to me

### [_Return_, Lydian Collective](https://lydiancollective.bandcamp.com/album/return)

I wasn't familiar with Lydian Collective before this year. I found them by listening to "Shubh Saran radio" on TIDAL. I really got into this "math rock" style of music this year, adn this album is great!

### [_Roll the Tape_, Adam Deitch Quartet](https://goldenwolfrecords.bandcamp.com/album/roll-the-tape)

This was one of my top albums from 2023 and I wanted to have it in my permanent collection.
