## TLDR

Salami, our beloved little dog, died on September 10th, 2024 at about 1:00pm central time. This obituary is part of my grieving process.

## The trip to the shelter

March 25th, 2021 was a Thursday. After a few weeks of discussion and online browsing, my life partner Patty and I went to the Austin Animal Shelter. This was our second trip - the first had been an attempt to familiarize ourself with the process so we could understand what to expect. While we weren't planning to settle for just any ol' dog, we were both prepared to commit to a dog that day if it felt right.

As we were roaming through the "small dog" section of the shelter, a small white chihuahua mix slowly approached the gate of her kennel and started wagging. She didn't bark, she didn't jump, she didn't prance or bound or run; she looked at us patiently and calmly with protruding eyes and massive ears. Her information card said she was 3 years old. She had been taken in that day, and didn't have a name or medical history.

We were encouraged to enter her kennel and interact with her a bit. In what would become Salami's trademark style, she approached us wagging and then immediately stopped wagging and hung her head when we started petting her. If we stopped petting her she would start wagging again and come slightly closer. We were a little confused by this behavior (indeed, we would remain confused for the remainder of her life ðŸ˜…), but the attendant gave us her opinion that this would be a great first dog for us. Despite the fact that neither Patty nor I were particularly drawn to chihuahuas, we decided that her demeanor fit us well and we decided to take her home.

The Austin Animal Shelter has a minimum three day waiting period during which previous owners can lay claim to their lost pets. While we normally would be able to take a dog home the same day, we had to wait three days for Salami to clear the waiting period. This was OK by us because, as first-time pet guardians (neither of us ever loved the term "pet parent"), we needed to prepare a little bit. We spent that Saturday planning our space, buying supplies at the pet store, and discussing how our schedules would change with a little dog in our lives. We were very excited!

On Sunday, March 28th, we went back to the Austin Animal Shelter and picked up Salami. To our surprise, we were presented with some extra supplies and were congratulated for adopting a "senior" dog. We looked at each other, confused, and then re-read the paperwork which now listed Salami's age as 8 years old, and indicated that she had been spayed previous to her arrival at the shelter. We were both surprised by this new information, but it didn't change the fact that this was the dog we wanted. After signing some paperwork and naming her, put her on a leash and left the shelter. We had a dog!

(An aside about her name: Salami did not have a name when we met her at the shelter. Normally the shelter will assign a name to animals, but Salami was so new when we saw her that she hadn't been assigned a name yet. We chose the name Salami because it made us laugh and smile - it was as simple as that.)

## Bringing Salami home

Salami settled into our lives immediately. She was a low energy dog, but her personality shown through in small ways. Despite buying her an expensive name-brand bed from a local pet boutique, she consistently preferred a bizarre DIY crochet rug I had made a few years prior. She had a distinctive way of "making her bed" which was one of her endearing trademarks: using only her front paws (never her mouth), she would pull at the blanket from a variety of angles until it was just perfectly ruffled for her liking.
