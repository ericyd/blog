My review of the movie [Trap](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26753003/):

> Just like Jaws, if the humans had said "We gonna get this shark. We're going to set a trap it can never escape. We're going to trap it in the Atlantic Ocean. We'll check every fish that comes out. There's absolutely no way it can escape."
