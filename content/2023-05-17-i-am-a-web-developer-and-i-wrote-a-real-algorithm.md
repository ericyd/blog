## TLDR

I've worked in tech for about 7 years - about 4 as QA and about 3 as a developer. Algorithms are an integral part of a software engineer's daily life, but the ones I wrote often appeared trivial and mundane compared to the Real Algorithms‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I encountered on platforms like LeetCode. Today, I wrote a practical breadth-first search algorithm that went beyond the basic examples typically found in problem sets! Proof that even web developers sometimes need to know Real Computer Science‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.

## The problem

At [Quil](https://getquil.com), we use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for our payment processor. One of Stripe's most powerful features is the ability to send webhooks for every conceivable event. We use webhooks to synchronize our internal payment records with Stripe's system. For instance, we want to update an invoice status from `Open` to `Paid` or `Canceled` when the status changes in Stripe.

As we built out more and more webhook handler functions, we discovered that a common thread among all of them was finding the user in our system that was associated with the webhook. We decided that before we delegate to any specific webhook handler function, we should ensure that we can find a user associated with the generic webhook event. If we cannot find a user, we log and throw an error. (Our webhooks processor is an AWS Lambda so throwing is safe and efficient.)

A brief aside: it is important to know that Stripe webhooks are (unsurprisingly) JSON objects. The JSON objects share common top-level keys, and event-specific data is nested within the `.data.object` property. The `.data.object` object is itself a deeply-nested JSON object whose structure varies depending on the webhook event. Stripe's documentation is exhaustive as to what structure each webhook takes, so it is possible to simply enumerate through the known webhook types and check for user properties based on what we know "should" exist on the JSON object. However, this approach resembled what we had been doing within each specific event handler function, so we aimed to develop a more generic method for finding a user based on the JSON object's properties. Here's an example of a JSON webhook object (with most of the data removed to highlight the structure):

```json
{
  "id": "evt_123",
  "object": "event",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "ch_123",
      "customer": "customer 123",
      "billing_details": [
        {
          "customer_email": "test@example.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "type": "charge.succeeded"
}
```

With that context, let's take a look at our `findUser` function. The function's algorithm goes roughly like this:

1. Does the webhook contain a `customer` key whose value is a `string`?
   1. Yes: query for a user in our DB using the Stripe customer ID. Return this user (or `null` if none exists)
   2. No: continue
2. Does the webhook contain a `customer` key whose value is an `object` with a key named `email`?
   1. Yes: query for a user in our DB using the email. Return this user (or `null` if none exists)
   2. No: continue
3. Does the webhook contain a `customer` key whose value is an `object` with a key named `id`?
   1. Yes: query for a user in our DB using the `customer.id`. Return this user (or `null` if none exists)
   2. No: continue
4. Fallback: Try to find a top-level key in the object containing the substring `"email"`, and use the value of that key to query for a user

For most webhooks, this algorithm worked, but a week ago we got a webhook that did not conform to any of these expectations and threw an error when the user was not found. Of course this was our bug, not Stripe's. The user existed and the webhook was well-formed; we were just lazy when we wrote the initial implementation. (Note: I can say "lazy" because "we" was actually "me" in this story üôÉ).

The first implementation for our "fallback" step was to just loop through the top-level keys of the webhook object and look for a key with the substring `"email"`. The webhook that threw an error didn't have any top-level keys that met this criteria, but it did have nested keys that met this criteria. This got me thinking about optimizations to our "fallback" search.

## The solution

I realized that if I treated the object like a heterogeneous tree structure, I could use a breadth-first search to find a nested key containing the substring `"email"`. Why did I use breadth-first instead of depth-first? My assumption was that Stripe would likely put the most important information in top-level keys, and for most cases it would be fastest to search from the top down. I also assumed that, in some weird circumstance where a webhook contained two different emails (I'm not even sure this is possible), the one at the top of the object was more likely to contain the information I wanted.

Let's take a short moment to ask the hard questions. Was implementing a breadth-first search the simplest solution to fix the problem? Heck no! In a world filled with constant demands on my time and energy, was this the optimal use of my limited resources? Definitely not!

But...was it fun? Ok, fine, yes it was üòè

Here's my full solution (in TypeScript). I don't share this to brag about my programming prowess (or lack thereof), but rather to share what I consider to be a "real algorithm":

```typescript
/**
 * A (probably suboptimal) breadth-first search.
 * Goal is to find a key that contains "email"
 * in a deeply-nested, heterogeneous object, which we treat as a tree
 */
export function findEmail(obj = {}): string | null {
  function search(stack: ReturnType<typeof Object.entries>): string | null {
    const children = [];
    for (const [key, value] of stack) {
      if (key.includes("email") && isNonEmptyString(value)) {
        return value;
      }
      if (Array.isArray(value)) {
        children.push(
          // if `value` is an array, the only useful items inside are Objects,
          // in which case we want their `entries`.
          // Primitives, or nested arrays, are not useful here.
          ...value
            .filter((item) => type(item) === "Object")
            .flatMap(Object.entries)
        );
      } else if (type(value) === "Object") {
        children.push(...Object.entries(value));
      }
    }
    if (children.length > 0) return search(children);
    return null;
  }
  return search(Object.entries(obj));
}

function isNonEmptyString(value: unknown): value is string {
  return typeof value === "string" && value.trim() !== "";
}

// We need a function that can differentiate Objects, Arrays, and Null/Undefined (unlike `typeof`).
// If you can tolerate adding a dependency, just use `type` from ramda
// https://github.com/ramda/ramda/blob/241f81126cefe87147120b09ab4090c0ca89b244/source/type.js
function type(value) {
  return value === null
    ? "Null"
    : value === undefined
    ? "Undefined"
    : Object.prototype.toString.call(value).slice(8, -1);
}
```

To test that it is performing breadth-first search, you can call it with an object that has nested "email" keys on either side (alphabetically) of a top-level "email" key.

```javascript
const obj = {
  a: [{ email: "test@example.com" }],
  customer_email: "customer@example.com",
  z: [{ email: "test@example.com" }],
};
findEmail(obj); // => 'customer@example.com'
```

## Why was this a notable experience for me?

As a professional in the tech industry, I'm inundated with the popular opinion that the only way to get a "good job" is by grinding on LeetCode for hours/days/months prior to any interview. However, I'm convinced that deeply knowing algorithms and data structures is overkill for most web development jobs, which, in my experience, often boil down to ["VendorOps"](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/08/14/jobs/){{< sup 1 >}}. On top of that, I'm living proof that deep expertise in algorithms and data structures isn't necessary to land a "good job" because I don't have deep experience in these topics and I love my job.

I am by no means suggesting that algorithms and data structures are not important - I would argue it is critical to understand the difference between an Object and an Array (and to know that other languages might refer to an "Object" as a Hash, HashMap, Map, Dictionary, or Struct, and refer to an "Array" as a List, Stack, or Vector) and when to reach for one over the other. But the "classic" algorithms questions that one might come across in "interview prep" problem sets are extremely unlikely to come up in the day-to-day experience of most web developers. In addition, we now live in the era of LLMs where you can generate a probably-mostly-adequate answer to a problem like this in seconds.

All this is to say that, in general, I believe having an understanding of high level concepts from the study of algorithms and data structures is very useful, and maybe even critical to being successful as a software professional. However, in my experience, it is exceptionally rare to be able to identify a "classical" algorithmic solution to a "real world" web development problem. So, when I had this experience myself, it was exciting and struck me as worthy of a blog post!

What do you think? Is it useful for most jobs to study algorithms and data structures in depth? Find me on the internet somewhere to tell me what you think!

{{< sup 1 >}}I think that "Rachel By the Bay" has a somewhat cynical (and possibly a tad elitist) perspective on "VendorOps" jobs. While I don't share this opinion, I do sympathize with it. I am a self-taught programmer who feels good about being able to make it in the tech world with minimal relevant professional training. I've never worked in a job where we _weren't_ doing "VendorOps", and so my perspective is of course quite different from Rachel's. I think that the world of web development is almost always about managing vendor issues because, let's face it, most websites are fairly straightforward in functionality. Of course, that doesn't mean they aren't hard to build! There are lots of nuances when it comes to making a product work in a functional way, even if it _is_ just a conglomeration of vendor libraries. All this is to say: I think VendorOps can be a difficult job with very real challenges, which I am not sure Rachel By the Bay would agree with. And, I _also_ think it is fundamentally different work than what Rachel calls "software engineering", e.g. writing a database engine or something like that.
