## Goal

Add a basic `Scene` component, which should be a container for all the `Track`s in the loop. A `Scene` should be able to add `Track`s, and the `Track` component should be able to delete itself from the `Scene` track list.

## Implementation

This was a pretty boring task, mostly some simple React components. I refactored the "Container" styles into a new component so the Metronome and Scene would look the same. I'm not totally sure I'll keep this styling but for quick iteration I wanted it to be visually consistent.

The only thing that held me up on this task was forgetting to put the `key` prop in the right place ü§¶üèª. Initially, I added it to the [top-level `div` in the `Track` component](https://github.com/ericyd/loop-supreme/blob/ba3fdde495330d0ad5b74b17e863a50edbf90c75/src/Track/index.tsx#L14), rather than [on the actual `Track` component rendered in the `Scene`](https://github.com/ericyd/loop-supreme/blob/ba3fdde495330d0ad5b74b17e863a50edbf90c75/src/Scene/index.tsx#L35). This caused the "remove" functionality to break and I was scratching my head until I realized my silly mistake.

## Status of app

- Merged PR https://github.com/ericyd/loop-supreme/pull/5
- Refactored some styling into a wrapper component
- The app now has a `Scene` which can hold one or more `Track`s!

## Next time

- Adding "record" functionality to the `Track` component!!! üôåüèª So pumped for this, when this is working I think we'll officially have a proof-of-concept.

## Time log

- probably an hour and a half?
