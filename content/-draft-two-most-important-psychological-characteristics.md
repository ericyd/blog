## TLDR

If your primary objective in life is professional _success_ (or money or prestige), then you probably want to cultivate an attitude of greed, selfishness, and cut-throat drive. I propose that a more fulfilling approach is to seek professional _happiness_, where your progress is measured by your level of happiness each day you finish work. If professional happiness is a goal for which you are interested in optimizing, then I have a useful hint for you: cultivate generosity and patience, and the rest will flow naturally.

## Professional goals

- Challenge
- Happiness
