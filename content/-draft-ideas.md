- In defense of death (because everyone wants to live forever)
- I've been consumed recently with the concept of "importance". As in, the fact that things are always important in the moment and rarely important in hindsight. That importance is fully self-ascribed yet we experience it as an immutable, irrevocable, fundamental quality of whatever phenomenon we deem important. How much control do we have over what we believe to be important? Is adjusting our view of what is important the key to peace? And compassion? (to recognize that other people believe a phenomenon to be important, even if you do not. And conversely, to recognize that you will believe certain phenomena to be important, even if others do not.) Is the sense of what is important in the world a defining characteristic of our unique human experience? Is our experience of importance directly tied to our values, or are there other factors that contribute to our sense of importance? What happens if we accept that nothing is inherently important, and we embrace the idea that things are only important when we ascribe that quality to them?

- "If you're searching for it, then it's already in front of you." This phrase came to me while tripping on acid at Port Aransas on the new year weekend. I can't quite find better words for it but I think it means everything you need is already here. Be content with what you have.
- French protests - what does it mean to be owed something by society or government? How does one quantify what is deserved? How does one quantify an equitable exchange of one's time and energy for money and social services? Why is it challenging to care for workers? What does the distribution of wealth tell us about this moment in history?
- Is there a moral imperative to give away your money? At what threshold? Is there a moral imperative to give away generational inheritance? What portion? For whom? Where is the boundary between passively accepting money (e.g. inheritance) and actively working against systemic inequality (e.g. hoarding money that historically was extracted from exploited labor)?

- "Texas is the best, Texas is the worst". Religious freedoms, voting rights, local self-governing, housing, drugs, abortion, health care, taxation. But god damn its nice to be outside every day of the year

- meaning of life
   - "He draws inspiration from the psychiatrist and author David Viscott, who said: â€œThe purpose of life is to discover your gift. The work of life is to develop it. The meaning of life is to give your gift away." "
