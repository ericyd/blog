Question: if you're deleting all your bug reports, how do you ever fix the little things that add shine to your product?

Answer: adopt a culture of continuous improvement.

This means
1. when you're in the code, look for ways to make it better instead of just achieving the exact acceptance criteria of the ticket. Try to always improve things, even if they are slightly out of scope.

Other benefits
1. This avoids "requirement drift", where a bug might not even be valid in the future because the application has changed and it is no longer reproducible.
