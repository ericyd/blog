Suffering = Pain ✖️ Resistance

(I stole this from the "Happier" app 😬)

My takeaway: pain is inevitable, but suffering is not. Resistance to pain is controllable, therefore you can control your suffering even though you cannot control your pain.

This is a great mantra to practice mental strength when engaging in uncomfortable tasks such as exercise or cold showers.
