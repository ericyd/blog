Following the idea laid out by Kevin Kelly in [Freakonomics Episode 507, "103 Pieces of Advice That May or May Not Work"](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/103-pieces-of-advice-that-may-or-may-not-work/), here is a list of advice from me. Is it good? Who knows!

1. Be critical of any advice you read online
2. Be intentional with how you spend your time.
3. Come to terms with the fact that you can either do a lot of things at a mediocre level, or a few things at a high level. Neither is inherently better or worse, but you can't have it all.
4. Instead of pursuing ever more complicated ways of managing your power user work habits, consider an alternative: reverting to a simpler way or working. Rather than an additive approach to your process, consider a subtractive process. Taking away complexity may unlock far more power than adding capabilities to "do more".
5. Generosity and patience are the two most important psychological characteristics to maximize professional happiness.
6. Get enough sleep.
7. Decide for yourself what is "enough sleep".
8. Embrace "good enough".
9. Not everything is truly important enough to get done. It is natural and OK to let some things drop off your To-Do list. Think of a sick day - does the world end even though you stopped being productive for a day? Of course not. Apply this logic to more of life and figure out what you might be doing that isn't essential.
10. Satisfying the ego is not inherently superior to boosting others egos, and we actually are less important than we think. Selflessness is perfectly OK, and has more value than much of society assigns to it.
11. Don't worry too much about maximizing your money. You may already have enough, and chasing more will only serve to make you greedy.
12. Ego is simply a survival mechanism. Once you reach a threshold where you don't need ego for survival, you no longer need to feed your ego. It will only prevent you from being compassionate and patient.
13. Regarding online outrage culture: Remember that you are but a single person. Your outrage does not matter to anyone but yourself. In 100 years or less, all vestiges of your existence will be scattered at an atomic level, and wholly dissociated from your person.
14. The meaning you assign to your own actions is the most important metric of value. You have ultimate freedom to make the life that you want to live.
15. The next time you want to say something, stop and ask yourself whom it benefits. If it is only yourself, shut up.
16. People are so reluctant to let you make mistakes, they would rather stop you from acting at all than let you act and learn from a mistake. I think some people assume that at some point in life, you stop making mistakes. But mistakes are as normal as life. You keep paying attention and you keep learning. There is only an end to mistakes if you stop living; the act of being alive and making choices is an act of accepting the possibility of mistakes.
