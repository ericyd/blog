## Favorite Deep Grooves: King Canyon - King Canyon, Eric Krasno, Otis McDonald

https://songwhip.com/kingcanyon/king-canyon

King Canyon's debut album, _King Canyon_, is confusingly listed as the product of three artists (King Canyon, Eric Krasno, Otis McDonald) despite the fact that King Canyon is itself a group made up of Krasno, McDonald, and Mike Chiavaro. Is this some sort of recursive self-referential name like [YAML](https://yaml.org/)?

Confusing credits aside, I really love this album! If you like groove-oriented jams √† la Khruangbin or Surprise Chef, you will love this album. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it is too short! I am not sure what to call the genre: there are elements of rock, blues, soul, and probably many other things that I'm too ignorant to name correctly. This album works well in the background or foreground which is also a plus for me.

## Favorite Rock Album: 72 Seasons - Metallica

https://songwhip.com/metallica/72-seasons

Wow, who knew Metallica was still making music??? And what a refreshing surprise! I've never considered myself a big Metallica fan, but I stumbled across their new album when watching this [entertaining video of Thomas Lang speed-learning one of their new songs on drums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv5Rhp3fX60). Turns out it is a really fun, classic-sounding rock album! They do a great job of balancing heaviness with approachability, and there's no point in the album where they veer off course. The whole composition is very strong, and did I say, fun! The title track "72 Seasons" is a great opener and remarkably catch. "Lux √Üterna" and "Room of Mirrors" are both really strong tracks too. Excellent "pump you up" music for a workout, or just regular work!

### Runner up: In Times New Roman... - Queens of the Stone Age

https://songwhip.com/queens-of-the-stone-age/in-times-new-roman

Speaking of other rock bands that nobody knew were still in business: Queens of the Stone Age! I did not have high hopes for this album; they kinda lost me at Era Vulgaris. But dang I'm really happy I gave this a listen! It doesn't push the envelope too far, but it has a lot of fun, riff-based rock music. If you have ever liked QOTSA's music, this deserves a listen.

## Favorite Emotive, Cinematic Break-Beat Trio Album: Everything Is Going to Be OK - GoGo Penguin

https://songwhip.com/gogo-penguin/everything-is-going-to-be-ok

Alright, I'll admit that I stole this categorization from [GoGo Penguin's official site](https://gogopenguin.co.uk/) (shame on me). But really, what else would you call GoGo Penguin? I think they probably appeal to a lot of jazz lovers, but are they jazz? Their audience probably has a lot of overlap with various types of EDM and electronica, but GoGo Penguin is fundamentally a live performance trio, so not exactly DJ-at-a-turntable either.

Anyway, here's what you need to know about _Everything Is Going To Be OK_: it is utterly beautiful. Please do yourself a favor: dim the lights, pour yourself a glass of wine or peppermint tea, find a cozy seat and crank this album. It has depth, it has texture, it has melodies for days, it has rhythms that don't make sense but are somehow completely natural. There are too many good tracks on this album: "Friday Film Special", "We May Not Stay", the title track "Everything Is Going To Be OK", and "Parasite" are all very strong. Next time you need to be alone and feel in awe of the universe, this is your album.

#### Top candidates / need to listen again

## Lotus Glow - Adi Oasis

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/266900810](https://tidal.com/browse/album/266900810)

- R&B mostly. Really nice grooves actually. Funky backing tracks
- Good atmosphere, feel-good arrangements
- Some really great grooves from the band actually, it is really a band, not just a solo singer
- I really like this album actually, its _very_ funky and just really fun compositions
- This has become a staple of "cleaning day music". Easy to listen to but really rich, interesting, and fun sounds!
- This is a really great album. I feel like other times of the year, it spoke to me more, but I do really like it.


## Six - Oli Howe, HOWES3

https://tidal.com/browse/album/325499911

1. Great modern prog-jazz/fusion vibes! Really fun and solid album. If you like Snarky Puppy, you'll like this!!
2. This is a GREAT album!!! I love this kind of shit, and it is **really** well done!! 

## Roll The Tape - The Adam Deitch Quartet

https://tidal.com/browse/album/306462752

1. **Really** solid jazz/funk grooves! Dance-able, and surprisingly rich for a quartet
2. Sounds like classic old-school Lettuce, no wonder I like it üòõ
3. Honestly really solid album from start to finish though. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
4. From the liner notes: "The album features organist Wil Blades, Lettuce cohorts Eric ‚ÄúBenny‚Äù Bloom on trumpet and Ryan Zoidis on saxophone, and a feature from legendary guitarist John Scofield on the leading single ‚ÄúMushroom Gravy‚Äù."

## Volcano - Jungle

https://tidal.com/browse/album/280609853

- Upbeat album, kind of like soul-electronica? Not totally accurate but organic beats, some interesting and pleasing vocals.
- I like this a lot, definitely feels like a contender
- "Back on 74" is really nice, probably my fav track so far

## That! Feels Good! - Jessie Ware

https://tidal.com/browse/album/290581948

- dancey, poppy, feels good. It will make you move. It will make you funk. It will make your head bop.
- _Free Yourself_ feels kind of like a disco-era club hit
- Title track has some ridiculously funky instrumentation and riffs
- _Shake The Bottle_ has one of those dead-simple-meets-ultra-funky bass lines that is reminiscent of her earlier _What's Your Pleasure_ album. It sounds like something that Bootsy Collins would write back in the day.

## Ask - Altin G√ºn

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/284698087](https://tidal.com/browse/album/284698087)

- Psychedelic Turkish rock. Pretty good! Deserves another listen. I'm not sure its a top album of the year but it is good
- second listen, I like this more than I remember. I think it could be a contender. Really good music, and pretty melodically interesting.

## Madres - Sofia Koutesis

https://tidal.com/browse/album/307304924

- Same short notes as the Madres EP but includes a few more tracks!
- Cecilia is very nice
- The whole album is really interesting; dance vibes and beats and really soft acoustic instrumentation/vocals over the top

## Welcome to the Hills - Yussef Dayes, Charlie Stacy, Rocco Palladino

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/243104004](https://tidal.com/browse/album/243104004)

- interesting, kind of dark jazz
- damn this is a very jammy jazz album! I like that the compositions are darker, they feel kind of complex and slightly untethered, but still are a lot of beauty to them. And some really cool solos
- some parts are actually riff-based, which I think is what was eluding me about it. "Palladino Sauce" starts with a phaser-ed bass riff that sounds like it could open a rock anthem. Then moves into a fantastic syncopated riff.
- Strong contender!


--------------------------------------

## Everything Is Going to Be OK - GoGo Penguin

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/285513521](https://tidal.com/browse/album/285513521)

[https://songwhip.com/gogo-penguin/everything-is-going-to-be-ok](https://songwhip.com/gogo-penguin/everything-is-going-to-be-ok)

- lovely ‚ò∫Ô∏è
- "Friday Film Special" is probably an early front runner for fav track. It has one of those melodies that feels like its been around forever and finally found a medium to come into the world.
- some really neat electronic textures throughout. Very full sound (although they have never really been a "thin" sounding band)
- "We May Not Stay" feels very narrative
- title track is fabulous, amazing bass lines and really beautiful organic growth to the climax
- damn "Parasite" is great too!!!


## 72 Seasons - Metallica

https://tidal.com/browse/album/288984589

- Such a fun, classic-sounding rock album!
- Title track "72 Seasons" is really great
- "Lux √Üterna" is really fun - Thomas Lang video!
- "Room of Mirrors" is so catchy!
- Successfully finds a challenging balance between "heavy" and "approachable"


## King Canyon - King Canyon

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/266766309](https://tidal.com/browse/album/266766309)

- Smooth, groovy, melodic, jammy, what is not to like!
- Only bad thing I can say about it is too short!
- This has some similarity to Khruangbin or Surprise Chef in some places. Reverb-y, groovy. I really like this.
- Second listen 2023-12-22, I honestly cannot say anything bad about this album. I *really* like every song. I wish it was longer, but as a whole package it is really an excellent album. I can see this fitting in so many moods. It has enough energy to work for coding, but it's also mellow enough to work while playing board games, or just background music. But it is musical enough that you can listen closely and find lots of interesting music and textures.


## Feel The Spirit - Lucas De Mulder, The New Mastersounds

https://tidal.com/browse/album/321197796

1. Classic New Mastersounds sound. Very agreeable, very funky, very good!
2. I've listened to this album a few times. It is very fun, but I don't think it's a "best of 2023" album

## Solar Music - Butcher Brown

https://tidal.com/browse/album/319065250

- very nice. I like it but I was in a bad mood when I listened first. Give it another try.
- Second listen 2023-12-24 there are some great tracks, but a lot of it is weird and not my fav.

## Sunblind - Jacana People

https://tidal.com/browse/album/294977629

- Really nice electronica album!
- second listen 2023-12-22 perfectly nice but doesn't really stick out. Feels more like something that is nice to listen to but not a super standout.

## Tchompitoulas - Galactic

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/271984687](https://tidal.com/browse/album/271984687)

- Groovy, funky
- dirty, tight, powerful funk. Classic Galactic
- New Orleans style blues / brass
- very fun album!
- Second listen 2023-12-22 this is fun, but there's some "weird" music here that isn't quite working for me. Some strange vocal tracks that don't feel like they fit super well.


## Inflorescence - Mike Dillon and Punkadelic

[https://found.ee/Inflorescence](https://found.ee/Inflorescence)

- Groove-based jazz
- Title track is a compelling journey; hopeful, intense, interesting
- Some interesting fluidity with time... the band doesn't always seem to agree on where the downbeat is



## Phil Ranelin and Wendell Harrison JID016

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/264117758](https://tidal.com/browse/album/264117758)

- Some fairly avante-garde pieces. The intro track is very spacy and freestyle
- Also some really tight grooves! "Running With The Tribe" is a really tight groove and great arrangement
- Very interesting album, and fun! Interesting mix of spacey atmosphere and groovy. They do a good job of playing with time through the whole album


## Winter - Otis McDonald

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/251576877](https://tidal.com/browse/album/251576877)

- Really interesting album. Pretty short, just over 20mins total runtime. I need to give this another listen

## DƒÅM-FunK Presents The Music Of Grand Theft Auto Online Original

https://tidal.com/browse/album/329269376

1. Ok, not amazing. Also seems like a compilation album?

## Live at Alexandria Palance London, 24th May 2023 - Four Tet

https://tidal.com/browse/album/323604985

1. If you like Four Tet, this is a perfectly enjoyable album, but 

## Senses - Crackazat

https://tidal.com/browse/album/299513996

1. Really great electronic album! The first few tracks are much stronger than the second half, but a good album overall.

## Make Up The Edits 3 - Chez Damier, Camille, Nico Lahs

https://tidal.com/browse/album/290301839

1. Really classic funk/soul/house beats. Would be great for a party, and is generally a fun album to have on! I don't know if it's the deepest compositions of the year, but really fun/good album.
2. Some almost "nu-jazz" feel to it. Like a classic 4-on-the-floor kick with retro sampled licks over the top.
3. Feels like old disco.

## Cream and Sugar - Duo Brothers

https://tidal.com/browse/album/281169761

1. Really nice. Retro soul vibes, great grooves, good synths.
2. Very easy to listen to, feels good
3. Has that rare mix of being very pretty, but with deep pockets

## The Lucky One - Cory Wong

https://tidal.com/browse/album/309825276

1. I mean, of course there are some bangers on here, but I gotta say as a whole, it's a little too happy-springy-poppy for me :shrug:

## Chronicles of a Diamond - Black Pumas

https://tidal.com/browse/album/322890141

1. Any album that opens with a tasty conga groove is probably gonna be good
2. Kinda soul-infused rocky jams? Maybe "soul" is the best description for this.
3. Definitely a modern rock album, but has some nice retro/vintage vibes. Really good sound.

## Oscillate - Alexander Flood

https://tidal.com/browse/album/281342904

1. Weird, but enjoyable!

## For That Beautiful Feeling - The Chemical Brothers

https://tidal.com/browse/album/313933864

1. Fun, but not amazing

## Filter System - Polyrhythmics

https://tidal.com/browse/album/291528140

1. Deserves another listen, I enjoyed it. Pretty laid back, but nice syncopated grooves

## Que Dios Te Maldiga Mi Corazon - The Mars Volta

https://tidal.com/browse/album/286490180

1. Acoustic, but very nice. If you like the Mars Volta's vibe then it's really good.

## It's Ok, B U - Kiefer

https://tidal.com/browse/album/306758889

- Lots of nice textures and grooves. I think it deserves another listen. It didn't completely knock me out but I definitely felt a desire to return to it. I enjoyed all of it.
- jazzy, electronic grooves. Like imagine smooth 80s pads, pocket drums, and tasty rhodes lines over the top. That's like half the album.

## Soul,PRESENT - Q

https://tidal.com/browse/album/292354008

- WHOA. First three tracks are EXCELLENT
- retro funk/soul vibes. Reminds me of this album actually, which I also love!!! Chanti Darling: https://tidal.com/browse/album/91987442
- Nice falsetto
- upbeat. Damn, I am DIGGING this. Slap bass, funk synth bass, so funky
- Maybe future listens will prove me wrong but this album is great.
- about halfway through, turns into a more mellow R&B album. Still really strong songwriting, but different vibe from the highly-danceable first 4 tracks

## Days in the Desert - High Pulp

https://tidal.com/browse/album/287308178

- one of the more interesting albums I've listened to in the past couple weeks

## Slugs of Love - Little Dragon

https://tidal.com/browse/album/292747938

- Groovy, electronic, fun, bop, light hearted, catchy, lush.
- First impression is VERY good! Feels like a contender

## PetroDragonic Apocalypse; or, Dawn of Eternal Night: An Annihilation of Planet Earth and the Beginning of Merciless Damnation - King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard

https://tidal.com/browse/album/299065996

- Metal (?). Heavy grooves throughout! Pretty in your face
- well made for sure, I'm not convinced it speaks to me more than being a fun change of pace, but then again I'm not sure!
- I guess I'm not sure when I would ever be craving to listen to it again

## In Times New Roman... - Queens of the Stone Age

https://tidal.com/browse/album/296746207

- Honestly a more solid album than I expected. Some really great grooves. Doesn't feel like it's pushing the envelope too much but it's classic QOTSA doing what they do best. Great riff-based rock music. Deserves another listen, I had a lot of fun on my first listen of this

## 1-800-SUC-CESS - Redinho

https://tidal.com/browse/album/295015169

- Whoa! Such a fun album! Great electro-funk vibes.
- Good for background or foreground listening, really enjoying this of my first listen
- ok on second listen, this is only OK. Fun album, good for background, but not a "top 5 of 2023" album

## Cloud Lifter - Sam Barsh

https://tidal.com/browse/album/291340976

- kind of unfocused? Some tracks are kind of trip-hop/instrumental hip-hop vibes, then _Duff and a Shot_ is like a retro blues/funk organ trio jam. I kind of like the vibes, it is all pretty groovy morning time music, I'm just not sure how cohesive it is as an album. (Granted, this is my "halfway through" reaction.)

## Friendship EP - Surprise Chef

https://tidal.com/browse/album/278822105

- pensive, groovy, spacey
- really good! Deserves another listen!
- interesting album, but a fun one

## Salt - Half Moon Run

https://tidal.com/browse/album/287079711

- kind of like crooning, acousting guitar pop?
- not something I see myself returning to very much
- not "bad" or anything, just not quite my style

## Off-Piste - Greg Foat, Art Themen

https://tidal.com/browse/album/288489375

- kind of atmospheric jazz in general. Not to say it's formless, but leans more towards "spacey" than "funky".
- very interesting textures, and some good grooves. Well made music
- I'd like to give this another listen if I have time

## Lean In - Gretchen Parlato, Lionel Loueke

https://tidal.com/browse/album/272608863

- I find this album pretty interesting, very mellow, lilting, melodic, happy, peaceful, rhymically interesting

## Ubuntu - Jonathan Butler

https://tidal.com/browse/album/280816123

- Lots of interesting influences here! Good album overall
- Some groovy, but mostly I'd say its a pretty album. Very melodic, very peaceful
- Would definitely like to listen to this again

## Krasno/Moore Project: Book of Queens - Eric Krasno, Stanton Moore

https://tidal.com/browse/album/281058057

- very bluesy! Some covers, but mostly originals (as far as I can tell)
- strong pocket grooves
- great easy listening jams

## A Good Woman - Izo FitzRoy

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/269842734](https://tidal.com/browse/album/269842734)

- bluesy, folksy, a little pop-y
- I think I like it, after the first few songs I'm very interested to hear the rest of it

## Riot Jazz Makes People Happy - Riot Jazz Brass Band

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/269857854](https://tidal.com/browse/album/269857854)

- High energy brassy funky groovy!
- overall the album is only ok actually :\ I was hoping for more but it didn't really do it for me. Couple great tracks but not mind blowing

## Brand New Life - Brandee Younger

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/286308904](https://tidal.com/browse/album/286308904)

- Surprisingly emotive. Maybe it was just the mood I was in, but I found the compositions and her singing to be quite beautiful
- mix of R&B and jazz. I think Brandee is a mallet instrument player, there is a lot of vibraphone on this album. Lots of harp too actually.
- This is a good album for sure, not sure if its "top 5" material or not but it is good!

## fOUR Step Aside - Nate Wood

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/245039310](https://tidal.com/browse/album/245039310)

- I didn't really like it. Kind of avant-garde electronic jazz-pop?

## Madres EP - Sofia Koutesis

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/279534070](https://tidal.com/browse/album/279534070)

- Electronic! Emotionally light, organic EDM. Some vocals but mostly used as an instrument.
- Happy vibes

## Life & Fire - Omar Klein, Haggai Cohen-Milo, Amir Bresler

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/277319688](https://tidal.com/browse/album/277319688)

- Jazz - piano, drum, bass trio
- Fun music! Dave Brubeck is coming to mind for some reason?

## Prime - Dave Stryker, Jared Gold, McClenty Hunter Jr.

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/262212838](https://tidal.com/browse/album/262212838)

- Organ trio (organ, guitar, drums)
- Fairly strong jazziness!
- Good but not "top 5" material i don't think

## Where You Wish You Were - Bill Laurence, Michael League

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/257607774](https://tidal.com/browse/album/257607774)

- I don't know how to describe the genre.
- Basically just piano and double bass
- The compositions are sometimes fun and bouncy, sometimes more thoughtful
- Definitely "jazz"... not totally sure its my thing, but its kind of nice.
- Some tracks remind me of a softer/slower version of GoGo Penguin. "Sant Esteve" is a good example of this style. Consistent hook, non-standard time signatures, kind of a monotonous pedal tone vibe from the guitar in certain sections

## COOKUP - Sam Gendel

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/269706613](https://tidal.com/browse/album/269706613)

- jazzy covers of classic pop + R&B songs, like from the 90s. Pretty weird album. Kind of interesting nostalgia, but not the most outstanding IMO

## BY THE WAY - Theo Croker

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/274054830](https://tidal.com/browse/album/274054830)

- R&B, neo-soul vibes. It is good! Not sure its my most fav album I've heard though

## Valley of Fire - El Ten Eleven

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/263458752](https://tidal.com/browse/album/263458752)

- honestly not sure what to call this. Kind of like light indie rock I guess, with a dark mood?
- deserves another listen, there is some interesting music here for sure

## Taken by Force - Civic

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/274869603](https://tidal.com/browse/album/274869603)

- Rock album. Not bad rock actually, just not what I listen to much anymore

## Raven - Kelela

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/271895787](https://tidal.com/browse/album/271895787)

- Kind of neo-soul, some pop
- Rich instrumentation, kind of classic neo-soul chanteuse semi-breathy vocals
- Nice beats, very listenable. Approachable sound

## SuperBlue: Guilty Pleasures - Kurt Elling, Charlie Hunter, Nate Smith

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/265466885](https://tidal.com/browse/album/265466885)

- Covers of classic soul/funk tunes
- Great musicianship as expected from these artists
- Definitely a fun album. First impression is not a "best of the year" album but some great grooves, maybe it will grow on me

## On the Far Side - Thomas Na√Øm

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/263174419](https://tidal.com/browse/album/263174419)

- SUMMARY: probably not for me, but a pleasant listen
- contemplative guitar-driven, soulful compositions
- relaxing
- textural
- deep pocket grooves
- dark soundscape
- this is a nice album but probably not a "best of 2023". I guess we'll see how I feel later in the year though. Very peaceful, well-composed, well-performed, but it isn't totally "my style". Slightly too sleepy

## Your Mother Should Know: Brad Mehldau Plays The Beatles

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/272455468](https://tidal.com/browse/album/272455468)

- didn't end up listening to this, I wasn't in the mood for solo piano playing beatles covers

## Unjust - Ben Wolfe

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/267247604](https://tidal.com/browse/album/267247604)

- really traditional jazz, I didn't listen to the whole thing but I couldn't get into it

## Legacy - Emile Londonien

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/258057189](https://tidal.com/browse/album/258057189)

- Jazz
- horns, rhodes, electric bass, grooving pocket drumming, hand percussion (congas?), synths. Opening track is jamming!
- the first three tracks are excellent. Grooves are a little "trippy" (need to look up what this is called when its laying back behind the beat), really great bass playing and cool instrumentation. Great atmosphere and interesting compositions
- on second listen, good but not great

# Not from 2023

## Heritage II - Mark de Clive-Lowe (2019)

[https://tidal.com/browse/album/224308107](https://tidal.com/browse/album/224308107)

- jazz, but heavy on texture. Not strongly groove oriented, but highly melodic and interesting harmonies and intstumentation
- its a good album, very interesting but also listenable. I'm compelled to come back for another listen
- I think this guy released something in 2023, but I don't remember liking it as much as this one
