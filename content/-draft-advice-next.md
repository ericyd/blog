[Last time I did this was in 2024](./2024-12-04-advice.md). I contemplated doing it annually, and clearly failed miserably.

[This is the original blog post which inspired the podcast which inspired by first attempt at this.](https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known/). Sadly, it is only 6 pieces of advice, with an advertisement to buy his book which contains many more. I didn't realize that when I first started writing "advice". Oh well, it doesn't change my prime motivation, which is to be a self-absorbed blowhard (blow-hard? blow hard?) who write to stroke his own massive ego.

A year late, here's another attempt at "annual life advice":

- Be kind to yourself when you don't meet your goals. You should never expect to meet all your goals; if you are, you're doing it wrong. Goals should be partially aspirational. Of course you should be _able_ to meet your goals, but you shouldn't be able to meet _all_ of your goals.
- Rotate your goals frequently. Build new strengths.
- Continue to cultivate skills which are meaningful to you. If you've built a strength by focusing on a certain aspect of life, don't be afraid to double down on it and aim for mastery.
- Avoid the pitfall of sampling hobbies forever. At some point in life it is worth making firm choices and aspiring towards greatness in a specific hobby.
- Pay attention to which feelings come easily. For example, maybe you feel sadness easily, or maybe joy, or maybe anger. You don't necessarily need to take action on this, but it's a useful to be aware of feelings that come easily because you can adjust your conditions to optimize those emotions (or find ways to nuture other emotions).
- Always be aware of where your joy comes from. You don't need to always follow your joy blindly, but you should always be aware of it's source. Treat it like a beacon which you point towards when you're unsure of where to go. Life is a meandering path; you will rarely point _directly_ towards your joy, but as long as you keep it in your periphery you are doing better than most.
- Accept your own limitations.
- Push extremely hard at your limits to make sure you've identified your true limitations, versus assumptions about your limitations.
