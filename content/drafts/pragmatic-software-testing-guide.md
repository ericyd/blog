- when to file a bug?
- comparison to policing: if your job is to find "bad behavior", then you will over-prioritize bad behavior
- when to discard bugs
- backlog: serves as a repo for what has been reported previously or not
- people don't search the backlog
- lets stop reporting useless/low value bugs
- when I was QA, I was very dedicated to the idea that "this is not right, and it is possible for it to be right, so it should be right". As a developer, I'm much more dedicated to the idea of pragmatism: if the enhancement doesn't provide value, or if it isn't causing issues in its current state, skip it.
