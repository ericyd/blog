# Eric's blog

This is where I publish things that I've written

I'm in the process of migrating from [Hashnode](https://ericyd.hashnode.dev/), so there might be a few rough edges.

Don't worry, I'll write a post about why I'm migrating away from Hashnode soon. Trust me - it's nothing bad! I think Hashnode is a great platform, I'm just looking for something different.
