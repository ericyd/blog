## TLDR

Salami, our beloved little dog, died on September 10th, 2024 at about 1:00pm central time. This obituary is part of my grieving process.

## The trip to the shelter

March 25th, 2021 was a Thursday. After a few weeks of discussion and online browsing, my life partner Patty and I went to the Austin Animal Shelter. This was our second trip - the first had been an attempt to familiarize ourself with the process so we could understand what to expect. While we weren't planning to settle for just any ol' dog, we were both prepared to commit to a dog that day if it felt right.

As we were roaming through the "small dog" section of the shelter, a small white chihuahua mix slowly approached the gate of her kennel and started wagging. She didn't bark, she didn't jump, she didn't prance or bound or run; she looked at us patiently and calmly with protruding eyes and massive ears. Her information card said she was 3 years old. She had been taken in that day, and didn't have a name or medical history.

We were encouraged to enter her kennel and interact with her a bit. In what would become Salami's trademark style, she approached us wagging and then immediately stopped wagging and hung her head when we started petting her. If we stopped petting her she would start wagging again and come slightly closer. We were a little confused by this behavior (indeed, we would remain confused for the remainder of her life ðŸ˜…), but the attendant gave us her opinion that this would be a great first dog for us. Despite the fact that neither Patty nor I were particularly drawn to chihuahuas, we decided that her demeanor fit us well and we decided to take her home.

The Austin Animal Shelter has a minimum three day waiting period during which previous owners can lay claim to their lost pets. While we normally would be able to take a dog home the same day, we had to wait three days for Salami to clear the waiting period. This was OK by us because, as first-time pet guardians (neither of us ever loved the term "pet parent"), we needed to prepare a little bit. We spent that Saturday planning our space, buying supplies at the pet store, and discussing how our schedules would change with a little dog in our lives. We were very excited!

On Sunday, March 28th, we went back to the Austin Animal Shelter and picked up Salami. To our surprise, we were presented with some extra supplies and were congratulated for adopting a "senior" dog. We looked at each other, confused, and then re-read the paperwork which now listed Salami's age as 8 years old, and indicated that she had been spayed previous to her arrival at the shelter. We were both surprised by this new information, but it didn't change the fact that this was the dog we wanted. After signing some paperwork and naming her, put her on a leash and left the shelter. We had a dog!

Salami's change in reported age led to one of the recurring jokes/confusions of her time with us: how old is Salami? With no better information to go on, we took her "final" estimate at face value and claimed that she was 8 years old when we picked her up. We've never felt extremely certain about that estimate, but it is what we stuck with.

An aside about her name: Salami did not have a name when we met her at the shelter. Normally the shelter will assign a name to animals, but Salami was so new when we saw her that she hadn't been assigned a name yet. We chose the name Salami because it made us laugh and smile - it was as simple as that.

## Bringing Salami home

Salami settled into our lives immediately. She was a low energy dog, but her personality shown through in small ways. Despite buying her an expensive name-brand bed from a local pet boutique, she consistently preferred a bizarre DIY crochet rug I had made a few years prior. She had a distinctive way of "making her bed" which was one of her endearing trademarks: using only her front paws (never her mouth), she would pull at the blanket from a variety of angles until it was just perfectly ruffled for her liking.

Another of Salami's hilarious behavioral quirks was her unwillingness to sit on anything other than a soft surface. This, combined with her predilection for fluffing blankets, let us to nearly always bring a blanket when we brought her places in public. I fondly remember bringing her to a local coffee shop a year ago or so and setting her up on a chair with a blanket from home to sit on. (The coffee shop is currently operating out of a food cart so their seating is outdoors, and yes I asked before I set her on a chair.) Someone commented about how precious it was that I brought a blanket for her and it struck me how completely commonplace Salami's preferences had become to me. Of course it was absurd to bring a blanket for a dog to sit on in an outdoor coffee shop, but it felt completely normal to me.

Prior to bringing Salami into our lives, I had been going for daily morning walks, a habit I started during the pandemic to reduce my feelings of going stir-crazy. I was ecstatic to be able to bring our little dog with me on these walks, and she proved a fun companion (although somewhat lacking in stamina). It was a wild first few months getting used to having a pet for the first time. Negotiating personal boundaries (it was still mid-pandemic at this time) and dog boundaries was interesting and challenging. On top of that, Salami quickly made it clear that she had a fairly narrow range of dogs she found acceptable. Oddly, we discovered through trial and error that the dogs she was most likely to accept at face value were young, female dogs. We never understood this but this preference held until her final days. Of course there were male dogs and older dogs which she grew to know and like, but the initial greeting was never smooth with any of these dogs. Young female dogs on the other hand made for easy introductions and slowly brought us into the dog world. Several dogs we met in the first few months of having her led to lasting human friendships, too.

## Learning to eat

Salami's gastrointestinal tract was a near-constant source of anxiety for us as her guardians.

## Hiking

Shockingly, Salami was a pretty good hiking companion!

Taking her to the Lake Travis was also amazing.

## Getting old

About a year before her death, Salami started to show signs of her age. Our daily walks started getting slower and shorter. At her peak, we could walk about a mile in the mornings and it took us anywhere from 30-45 minutes depending on her speed. Slowly the mile walk turned into 3/4 of a mile, then half a mile. Her delightful little trot - only an intermittent experience in the best of times - became fleetingly infrequent, replaced by a slow saunter that became well known by our neighbors. It was common for neighbors to comment to us how slowly she walked, and we could only reply with a smile, a laugh, and a knowing remark.

## Saying goodbye

Salami's real troubles started in April 2024. We took her in for her annual dental cleaning, during which she received general anesthesia (a common practice for dog dental cleanings). The next day she had a seizure and it scared the shit out of me. This was not technically her first seizure - she had one a year or two prior at night. Patty had been the only witness, and it was apparently relatively short-lived. When we reported it to the vet, they said it shouldn't be concerning unless it happened again soon. The seizure in April 2024 was met with the same diagnosis - don't worry unless it happens again within 24 hours.
