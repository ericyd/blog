## TLDR

In the past 6 months, I've felt my desire to professionally strive for greatness completely evaporate. I blame it on AI: tech leaders and community have fully embraced the AI hype mania and are forcing AI adoption at all levels. I imagine this is historically similar to the industrial revolution, and it sucks to live through it.

## I'm tired

Just...stop. Please. I'm begging you. Exercise a modicum of restraint. I know things are moving fast, but doesn't that do even more to justify a step back? Surely, diving head-first into a racing torrent of innovation is no way to develop a sound strategy for a groundbreaking new technology. Can we all agree that we're actively working to learn the best ways to utilize these tools, all while the tools are currently being built? It seems unreasonable to me that we should be expected to have mastered a technology that isn't even fully formed.

Y'know what, I'm already off topic. The purpose of this post was not to argue for or against any particular approach to AI. It was simply to reflect on my reaction to it.

I'm tired of feeling afraid of what the future might hold. I'm tired of being forced to try new work modes when it is hard to point to specifically what was wrong about my previous work modes. I'm tired of feeling like a commodity.

More than anything, I think AI has made me feel unimportant. I realize it's a pretty privileged position to be in to expect to feel special at work, but such was life for a software engineer in the 2010s and early 2020s! My company has adopted a stance towards AI which is that non-engineers are capable of using AI to contribute small code changes. In theory I love this approach - no more stories to update a button color, etc! In practice it has been rough. Unless the AI does a perfect one-shot of the problem, it ends up just being code you have to fix yourself anyway, which is possibly worse than a ticket that says "update the button color". Maybe eventually AI will get there, but it turns out vibe coding in a large legacy codebase is still hard.

In addition, I can't see this ending any time soon. If this is how I'm feeling in 2026, how could I possibly hope to maintain my status and pay in 2030??? I feel like the writing is on the wall that I need to adapt quickly. I love challenges and I love learning, so why am I so resistant to this? Partly because it feels like running uphill in quicksand. There is no success criteria to become relevant in 5 years, there is only hoping that you stumble upon the right skill set to maintain your job until Replacement Day. I have very little hope that being a generic web services engineer who writes TypeScript will be a notable skill in 5 years (maybe less???). Certainly I could pivot, but to what? It's hard enough to change from a QA engineer to a developer (I know because I've done it), so why would it be any easier to change from a web app engineer to a (for example) database developer, particularly in the worst tech market of the past decade?

AI has made me feel lost and adrift for the first time since I started working in tech nearly a decade ago. I'm not exactly blaming anyone, just acknowledging how I feel. I can't imagine I'm alone. I'm sure I sound like a decel ("short for decelerationist" 😒), but I just want it to slow down. Maybe it's just selfishness. Maybe it's just privilege of being overpaid for so long. Whatever the reason, I'm feeling ready to throw in the towel.
