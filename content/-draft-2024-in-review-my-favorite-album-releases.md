## Albums I listened to

* _Mount Masu_, Yin Yin
    * https://tidal.com/browse/album/327318531
    * Very, very good! I am feeling like I'll want to buy this on Bandcamp
    * Groovy, smooth, and fukin' cool
* _MINT JAMS(Live)_, Casiopea
    * https://tidal.com/browse/album/157660479
    * super fun classic funk/prog/jams!
* _Robby Krieger & the Soul Savages_, Robby Krieger
    * really fun! Robby Krieger is the guitarist for The Doors apparently
* _The Drop_, Jeff Lorber
    * Released in 2023 but a really fun modern jazz album. It has that sound that I think turns off a lot of people, really shimmery keyboards, but I thought it was fun
* _Parasols_, Orgone
    * Just an EP but it is solid!
