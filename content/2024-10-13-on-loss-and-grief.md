## TLDR

On September 10, 2024, [our dog Salami](https://ericyd.com/salami) died. I loved her very much and in the weeks since her death I've noticed changes in myself and how I engage with the world. This post is not intended to make any profound or universal observations about grief, but instead is meant to share my personal journey through this loss that significantly affected me.

In this essay, ambiguous references to "we" or "our" are probably referring to my partner Patricia and myself.

## Not too long, did read

Salami's death was relatively sudden. Although her energy had been declining gradually for about a year, she seemed in many ways a healthy, aging dog. Nothing highly unusual was detected during vet visits, including the additional xrays and blood screenings we did when we were worried about unusual behavior. She starting having very intermittent seizures (about 1x/month) approximately 6 months before her death. A week before her death, she had a "cluster" of 2 seizures in one day, which prompted us to bring her to the pet ER. The ensuing week was extremely painful as I saw her slipping away. 9 days after the initial ER visit and after several subsequent vet visits and seizures, we made the difficult decision to euthanize her. Based on all the information available to us including from a dog neurologist, there was no immediate hope of restoring her quality of life. Further testing would have required her to spend days or weeks in an oxygen kennel - isolated and effectively immobilized to protect her damanged respiratory system. We made the choice to say goodbye in a controlled setting instead.

It still hurts sharply to recall the conditions of her death. More than a month later, I still miss her every single day. I suppose that is probably not uncommon for pet guardians who suffer a loss, but I didn't know what to expect. Salami was our first pet, and we had her for about 3 and a half years. We never knew her true age but based on the best guess from the shelter, she was 11 and a half years old when she died. We thought we would have more time.

One of the more persistent reflections I've had was just how much I loved our dog. I knew that I loved her, but I did not understand the depth of my love until she was gone. Although her loss has been incredibly painful at times, I can't help but feel deeply fortunate to have felt such a deep love for another living being. I think that one reason dog guardians can love their dogs so much is because dogs return your love unconditionally and in equal parts. Salami was a fairly non-interactive dog. She was old and slow, she never played with toys, she never fetched anything, she never played with other dogs (we tried all of the above many times). And yet, she gave me exactly what I needed, which was purpose, structure, and companionship. She always followed me around at home, she woke up with me every day, and her walking and eating schedule gave me reliable structure to my days and weeks. Just as importantly, she received all my love openly and without expectation. It feels so good to love a dog and know that they accept you exactly as you are. Since dogs exist entirely in the present moment, their experience of love is similarly rooted in the present. They don't care if you forgot to show them love yesterday, or will forget tomorrow. The moment you are showing them love is the only moment in their world that matters. The purity of that experience of love is magical and I am so happy to have experienced that with her.

My grieving experience has also made me feel deeply compassionate towards other humans in my life. We were so lucky to have a strong network of friends and family who supported us through this loss, and validated everything we were feeling. I realized how much I missed out on supporting friends and loved ones who are grieving a loss. Grieving hurts, and it feels good to know that you aren't alone. I have missed many opportunities to help people I care about when they are grieving, and I feel deeply remorseful for times when I have not been as compassionate as I could have. This feeling has mostly come out of the observation of how significantly this grief has impacted my life. My quality of work has suffered, my motivation to do anything has suffered, my connection to friends has suffered, my joyfulness has suffered. This experience has significantly deepened my commitment to be kind to my fellow humans. It is impossible to know what the people around you are experiencing, and many of us have experienced loss, whether recently or in the past. There is so much pain in the world, and my experience with grief has opened me to it in a whole new way. I hope to take this feeling forward with me and commit myself to being as compassionate as possible towards others.

Along with compassion for humans, grieving Salami's loss has made me feel significantly more compassionate towards animal life. I don't understand the origin of this feeling as well as some of my other grief-related feelings, but I have been extremely aware of a compulsion to take care of animal life around me. One consequence of this feeling is that I decided to stop eating meat for the month of October. I may choose vegetarianism indefinitely, but I typically do not make hasty decisions and I don't feel a need to declare my long term dietary choices right now. Although vegetarianism is something I've considered for quite a while, I know beyond a doubt that Salami's death was the primary catalyst to make me choose vegetarianism right now. It makes me deeply sad to think about the conditions that animals are living in on industrial meat farms. It also makes me sad to think about the violence we force other humans to inflict on animals in the context of meat packing factories. Being forced to kill animals every day as a form of employment is not humane for either the animals or the human employees. I am not sure why feeling grief of our dog's death pushed me over the edge of wanting to forsake meat consumption, but I haven't had any hesitation that it is the best choice for me right now.
