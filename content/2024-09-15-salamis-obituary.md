## TLDR

Salami, our beloved little dog, died on September 10th, 2024 at about 1:00pm central time. This obituary is part of my grieving process.

## The trip to the shelter

March 25th, 2021 was a Thursday. After a few weeks of discussion and online browsing, my life partner Patty and I went to the Austin Animal Shelter. This was our second trip - the first had been an attempt to familiarize ourself with the process so we could understand what to expect. While we weren't planning to settle for just any ol' dog, we were both prepared to commit to a dog that day if it felt right.

As we were roaming through the "small dog" section of the shelter, a small white chihuahua mix slowly approached the gate of her kennel and started wagging. She didn't bark, she didn't jump, she didn't prance or bound or run; she looked at us patiently and calmly with protruding eyes and massive ears. Her information card said she was 3 years old. She had been taken in that day, and didn't have a name or medical history.

We were encouraged to enter her kennel and interact with her a bit. In what would become Salami's trademark style, she approached us wagging and then immediately stopped wagging and hung her head when we started petting her. If we stopped petting her she would start wagging again and come slightly closer. We were a little confused by this behavior (indeed, we would remain confused for the remainder of her life ðŸ˜…), but the attendant gave us her opinion that this would be a great first dog for us. Despite the fact that neither Patty nor I were particularly drawn to chihuahuas, we decided that her demeanor fit us well and we decided to take her home.

The Austin Animal Shelter has a minimum three day waiting period during which previous owners can lay claim to their lost pets. While we normally would be able to take a dog home the same day, we had to wait three days for Salami to clear the waiting period. This was OK by us because, as first-time pet guardians (neither of us ever loved the term "pet parent"), we needed to prepare a little bit. We spent that Saturday planning our space, buying supplies at the pet store, and discussing how our schedules would change with a little dog in our lives. We were very excited!

On Sunday, March 28th, we went back to the Austin Animal Shelter and picked up Salami. To our surprise, we were presented with some extra supplies and were congratulated for adopting a "senior" dog. We looked at each other, confused, and then re-read the paperwork which now listed Salami's age as 8 years old, and indicated that she had been spayed previous to her arrival at the shelter. We were both surprised by this new information, but it didn't change the fact that this was the dog we wanted. After signing some paperwork and naming her, put her on a leash and left the shelter. We had a dog!

Salami's change in reported age led to one of the recurring jokes/confusions of her time with us: how old is Salami? With no better information to go on, we took her "final" estimate at face value and claimed that she was 8 years old when we picked her up. We've never felt extremely certain about that estimate, but it is what we stuck with.

An aside about her name: Salami did not have a name when we met her at the shelter. Normally the shelter will assign a name to animals, but Salami was so new when we saw her that she hadn't been assigned a name yet. We chose the name Salami because it made us laugh and smile - it was as simple as that.

## Bringing Salami home

Salami settled into our lives immediately. She was a low energy dog, but her personality shown through in small ways. Despite buying her an expensive name-brand bed from a local pet boutique, she consistently preferred a bizarre DIY crochet rug I had made a few years prior. She had a distinctive way of "making her bed" which was one of her endearing trademarks: using only her front paws (never her mouth), she would pull at the blanket from a variety of angles until it was just perfectly ruffled for her liking.

Another of Salami's hilarious behavioral quirks was her unwillingness to sit on anything other than a soft surface. This, combined with her predilection for fluffing blankets, let us to nearly always bring a blanket when we brought her places in public. I fondly remember bringing her to a local coffee shop a year ago or so and setting her up on a chair with a blanket from home to sit on. (The coffee shop is currently operating out of a food cart so their seating is outdoors, and yes I asked before I set her on a chair.) Someone commented about how precious it was that I brought a blanket for her and it struck me how completely commonplace Salami's preferences had become to me. Of course it was absurd to bring a blanket for a dog to sit on in an outdoor coffee shop, but it felt completely normal to me.

Prior to bringing Salami into our lives, I had been going for daily morning walks, a habit I started during the pandemic to reduce my feelings of going stir-crazy. I was ecstatic to be able to bring our little dog with me on these walks, and she proved a fun companion (although somewhat lacking in stamina). It was a wild first few months getting used to having a pet for the first time. Negotiating personal boundaries (it was still mid-pandemic at this time) and dog boundaries was interesting and challenging. On top of that, Salami quickly made it clear that she had a fairly narrow range of dogs she found acceptable. Oddly, we discovered through trial and error that the dogs she was most likely to accept at face value were young, female dogs. We never understood this but this preference held until her final days. Of course there were male dogs and older dogs which she grew to know and like, but the initial greeting was never smooth with any of these dogs. Young female dogs on the other hand made for easy introductions and slowly brought us into the dog world. Several dogs we met in the first few months of having her led to lasting human friendships, too.

## Learning to eat

Salami's gastrointestinal tract was a near-constant source of anxiety for us as her guardians.

## Hiking

Shockingly, Salami was a pretty good hiking companion!

Taking her to the Lake Travis was also amazing.

## Getting old

About a year before her death, Salami started to show signs of her age. Our daily walks started getting slower and shorter. At her peak, we could walk about a mile in the mornings and it took us anywhere from 30-45 minutes depending on her speed. Slowly the mile walk turned into 3/4 of a mile, then half a mile. Her delightful little trot - only an intermittent experience in the best of times - became fleetingly infrequent, replaced by a slow saunter that became well known by our neighbors. It was common for neighbors to comment to us how slowly she walked, and we could only reply with a smile, a laugh, and a knowing remark.

## Saying goodbye

Salami's real troubles started in April 2024. We took her in for her annual dental cleaning, during which she received general anesthesia (a common practice for dog dental cleanings). The next day she had a seizure and it scared the shit out of me. This was not technically her first seizure - she had one a year or two prior at night. Patty had been the only witness, and it was apparently relatively short-lived. When we reported it to the vet, they said it shouldn't be concerning unless it happened again soon. The seizure in April 2024 was met with the same diagnosis - don't worry unless it happens again within 24 hours.

Salami didn't have another seizure until July 19th. A week later she had another seizure, which concerned us. We talked to the vet and they again were unconcerned. On August 14th we had a big scare when Salami woke us up at 4:30am howling during a seizure.

Two weeks later on August 31st, Salami had short seizure in the evening around 6pm. We got a video recording of this seizure which sucked to record but was good for medical documentation. At around 10pm that evening Salami had her second seizure of the day. It was a Saturday, so we went to the emergency hospital. The doctor did an exam and didn't find anything terribly out of the ordinary, but they strongly recommended we leave her overnight for a seizure watch. The next day (Sept 1st) when we picked her up, we were given a bottle of Keppra, an anti-seizure medication, and a prescription to refill it when this bottle ran out. We were told that she might continue to have seizures, but the Keppra should mitigate them in severity and frequency. They asked us to follow up with our primary vet again in 48 hours, which we did. The Keppra needed to be given orally 3 times a day at precise 8-hour intervals. Based on her intake and timing, that meant we had to give her meds at 11pm, 7am, and 3pm every day.

Two days later, we were getting ready to head to the vet for our 48 hour checkup and Salami had a small seizure. We were concerned and the vet finally seemed to treat her case with the severity it probably deserved in the past. We were informed that we could see a neurologist, but they vaguely indicated that they are typically prohibitively expensive unless patients have pet insurance. I wish they had given us more specifics - it turns out an office visit is only $180. I feel that if we had seen a neurologist earlier than we did, Salami might have been able stay with us for at least a few more months. Of course it's difficult to say what her quality of life might have been.

Salami continued to have seizures almost daily for the next few days. She was very lethargic and had a bad hacking cough that she had developed a few weeks prior. Unfortunately the cough medication was also an oral liquid which Salami hated. Over the course of the week, a deep pit developed in my stomach. I felt in my core that she was dying, but nothing the doctors told us indicated her rapidly she was declining. I kept feeling insane for seeing the life slowly leave my little dog but having the doctors tell us that we shouldn't worry unless she had two seizures in a day.

That weekend, I was a mess. I was absolutely saturated with anxiety and sadness and confusion. I didn't know what was happening, and all we knew is that we had a vet appointment coming up in another week. I was worried that Salami wouldn't last that long so I finally made a neurologist appointment after doing some more research. The appointment was for Wednesday, September 11th.

On Sunday, Sept 8th, Salami had a seizure at 10:44am. Then, at about 3:15, after receiving her afternoon Keppra dose, Salami had a second seizure. We dutifully packed up and headed to the ER, who once again recommended keeping her on a seizure watch. She stayed at the ER until about midnight and didn't have any seizures during that time. We took her home, grateful to have her back with us. She was low on energy but otherwise seemed to be doing pretty well. Patty, Salami and I all went on an evening walk together. This turned out to be our last quality time together.

On Monday morning, I woke up at 6:30 to get ready for Salami's 7am Keppra dosage. I knew as soon as I woke her up that she wasn't doing well. Almost immediately she had a small seizure, and then another after the Keppra dosage. She had just been at the ER and they didn't seem terribly concerned so I decided to wait. In the span of 2 hours, Salami had 4 small seizures. I told Patty we needed to go back to the ER.

This time there was a silver lining: their staff neurologist was available for an emergency checkup. The neurologist came to talk to us and told us it was really good that we came in. She told us that based on her physical exam, Salami's seizures had a structural source, meaning something other than simple epilepsy. She strongly suspected a brain tumor, and thought it was likely cancer, but without more diagnostics it wouldn't be possible to say for sure. Unfortunately Salami wasn't a good candidate for anesthesia at this point, so we had to just treat her symptoms. The neurologist said that Keppra is basically worthless for "structural seizures" (i.e. brain tumor seizures) so she switched her immediately to phenobarbital. Phenobarbital was initially dismissed as a medication because of how hard it is on the liver, and Salami already had a history of elevated liver enzymes (she was on a medication for it). However, given the severity of the situation, phenobarbital was deemed the best course of action. They asked to keep her again to make sure the seizures were under control.

A few hours later we received a call from the neurologist. She said that Salami's seizures had stabilized, but her breathing had not. Salami had been in an oxygen kennel all day and the staff had been unable to ween her off of the oxygen. When the night team called back a few hours later, Salami's situation had not changed. It crushed me to realize that I might have to say goodbye to my little dog the next day. That night, I hardly slept at all; I truly can't remember a more sleepless night in my life. The next morning, I anxiously awaited a call from the ER. When the neurologist called, it was with bad news. Salami was not able to get off the oxygen all night, which meant she would need to stay in the oxygen kennel. There was one last hail mary we could throw, which was to call an emergency rotating cardiologist, and try to do an EKG, and try to treat a hypothetical cardiovascular issue which was preventing Salami from breathing properly. But even if this had worked, Salami would have had to stay in the oxygen kennel for days, all alone.

The morning of Tuesday, September 10th, we made the decision to euthanize our sweet little dog. It was the worst decision I've ever had to make. It wasn't the _hardest_ decision, because I knew that Salami was suffering, but it was absolutely the worst decision I've ever had to make. The doctors didn't believe she could comfortably come home, because every time they reduced her oxygen, she started choking. Bringing her home would have effectively killed her by suffocation.

We were able to be with her at the end. It was truly terrible, but I'm also so grateful that we were able to be with her. I would have felt even worse knowing that she died without us there to comfort her. She was quite docile when the tech brought her in for a final goodbye. It was clear that she was on some strong medication, and she seemed slightly confused. A little bit later, we said goodbye to our dog for the last time.

The week since has been a constantly changing landscape of emotion. From the depths of sorrow to the open plains of confusion and bewilderment, it has been a nearly-constant tug of hard emotions. I'm incredibly grateful that Patty has been her with me through it because that means there is always someone who is feeling the same things I'm feeling; or if not, then at least understands deeply how I'm feeling.

I am surprised almost every day at how much I notice her absence. Anyone who met Salami knows that she was just about the most low-energy dog you could find. She was nearly silent, never played with toys or people, and had very little stamina for walks. But regardless, I fucking loved her. She was absolutely pure, and made me smile every day. I will continue to miss her severely. She brought nothing but joy to my life, and I will be eternally grateful for that.
