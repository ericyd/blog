## TLDR

A meditation on grief and death.

Because death comes for us all.

## I don't want a "celebration of life"

Do I want my life to be celebrated after my passing? If my successors{{< sup 1 >}} want to celebrate my life, then more power to them. But I won't be around for it, so I don't really care if my accomplishments are celebrated.

Celebrations of life are a modern trend to avoid the term "funeral". Funerals are dry, stuffy, and sad - no wonder they are out of fashion! Celebrations on the other hand are lively, fun, and joyous. Sounds like a no-brainer.

There's a problem: celebrations do not suggest a space to grieve. "Sad celebration" is an oxymoron because celebrations are built around praising accomplishments, not about mourning losses. If the accomplishment is not something to be praised, then a celebration is not the correct term.

Of course I'm not suggesting that dead people can't be celebrated. Much to the contrary, it is important to celebrate the accomplishments and lives of our ancestors. But that celebration can be an ongoing legacy of one's life. When a "celebration of life" is scheduled after a person's death, the explicit purpose of such a gathering is to honor the death of a meaningful life. Celebrations in this case provide a very narrow window of experience in which to communally experience death.

Celebrations come with all sorts of implicit expectations. You should smile at a celebration. You should laugh at a celebration. You should be happy at a celebration. You should feel good at a celebration. (Long-time readers{{<sup 2 >}}) will [recognize the repeated use of "should" as a red flag](/should-is-the-worst-word).)

Of course all of this is very enticing. Who doesn't want to smile, laugh, be happy, and feel good? The problem is that these emotions and behaviors are directly at odds with how most people are feeling in the wake of a loved one's death. Assuming you truly loved the person, their loss may make you feel some combination of mournful, depressed, angry, fearful, lost, and sad. These feelings are incompatible with a celebration, which means that these feelings will almost certainly be repressed when you go to "celebrate" this person's life. Repressing the natural feelings of loss after death is not a healthy way to mourn. Grieving is a natural part of life, and we should not shy away from it.

## The potential beauty of communal grief

The ability to grieve with others is a rare gift. Grief is often a one-sided affair; think of leaning on the shoulder of a friend or family member when you are grieving something in life. It is comforting to have support from a loved one, but if they do not share your grief, the experience is not fully shared.

In contrast, communal grieving offers a possibility for cartharsis that reaches much beyond what you may feel after grieving individually. It is well known that when groups of people all share in an emotional experience, the emotions and the experience are heightened. This is the psychology behind music festivals, church, sports events, political rallies, and so many other quintessentially human experiences. Getting "swept up in the crowd" is a powerful experience, one that often releases emotions that may not have surfaced if not for the communal energy. Anyone who has ever casually attended a sporting event, only to be swept up in the fervor of the crowd, knows this experience.

Communal grieving is no different, but sadly much less common in modern American society{{< sup 3 >}}.

For this reason, I want people to come to my funeral and _cry_. You don't even need to be mourning my loss. Bring your baggage, bring your disappointments, bring your failures, bring your losses, and mourn them all. Aim for release, aim for catharsis. Aim for healing and cleansing and rebirth. It is all within reach, but you have to open yourself to the possibility.
