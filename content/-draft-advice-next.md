[Last time I did this was in 2024](./2024-12-04-advice.md). I contemplated doing it annually, and clearly failed miserably.

[This is the original blog post which inspired the podcast which inspired by first attempt at this.](https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known/). Sadly, it is only 6 pieces of advice, with an advertisement to buy his book which contains many more. I didn't realize that when I first started writing "advice". Oh well, it doesn't change my prime motivation, which is to be a self-absorbed blowhard (blow-hard? blow hard?) who writes to stroke his own massive ego.

A year late, here's another attempt at "annual life advice":

1. Be kind to yourself when you don't meet your goals. You should never expect to meet all your goals; if you are, you're doing it wrong. Goals should be partially aspirational. Of course you should be _able_ to meet your goals, but you shouldn't be able to meet _all_ of your goals.
2. Rotate your goals frequently. Build new strengths.
3. Continue to cultivate skills which are meaningful to you. If you've built a strength by focusing on a certain aspect of life, don't be afraid to double down on it and aim for mastery.
4. Avoid the pitfall of sampling hobbies forever. At some point in life it is worth making firm choices and aspiring towards greatness in a specific hobby.
5. Pay attention to which feelings come easily. For example, maybe you feel sadness easily, or maybe joy, or maybe anger. You don't necessarily need to take action on this, but it's a useful to be aware of feelings that come easily because you can adjust your conditions to optimize those emotions (or find ways to nuture other emotions).
6. Always be aware of where your joy comes from. You don't need to always follow your joy blindly, but you should always be aware of it's source. Treat it like a beacon which you point towards when you're unsure of where to go. Life is a meandering path; you will rarely point _directly_ towards your joy, but as long as you keep it in your periphery you are doing better than most.
7. Accept your own limitations.
8. Push extremely hard at your limits to make sure you've identified your true limitations, versus assumptions about your limitations.
9. Protect life. Play with your pet, water your plants, take care of an elderly neighbor. It's worth it.
10. Eat good food. It's worth it.
11. Finding balance is one of the most difficult things in life. There are always competing interests, and choosing between them is a never-ending challenge. Be aware of the tradeoffs you are making by choosing one path over another.
12. Being perfectly balanced between all aspects of life sounds great, but it is unrealistic and probably unattainable for any significant amount of time. It is much better to accept that being slightly out of balance is natural.
13. Avoid getting too far out of balance.
14. Brush your teeth, you only have one set.
15. At some point you will die. If you're lucky, you'll have some time before you die to reflect on your life. If you have this chance, it will likely be incredibly meaningful for you to look back on your life and consider it to be well-lived. Strive to live well, in accordance with your values, so that you can eventually look back on your life and feel satisfied.
16. Recognize that your values may change over time, and it is OK for your past actions and values to not align with your current actions and values.
